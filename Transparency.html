        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The Do-Not-Track protocol both enables user control over tracking, and the delivery of "machine-readable claims" regarding the tracking behaviour of servers or web applications.
            This document addresses the latter transparency aspects, in light of European legal requirements.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            EU Privacy law requires that access to user agent storage is only allowed if the user has given consent,
            or that the storage is used for a limited set of exempted purposes.
            In addition EU Data Protection law says that personal data cannot be processed unless the purpose for the processing is claimed from the outset to be covered by at least one of 6 legal bases,
            the first of which being consent. In either case consent must be "freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous and based on a user's actions", 
            and (under the draft ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) proposal), "may be expressed by using the appropriate
            technical settings of a software application enabling access to the
            internet", and that "users shall be given the possibility to withdraw
            their consent at any time".

        </p>
        <p>
            The information to be given to the user must thus be
            <ul>
                <li>
                    given before the data is collected or processed;
                </li>
                <li>
                    clearly identify the responsible Data Controller or Controllers,
                    any Data Processors contracted to process personal data on their behalf,
                    and other recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data (GDPR A.13);
                </li>
                <li>
                    explain the modalities of collection, and purpose and legal basis of the processing, in a clear and intelligible way; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    explain any measure the end-user of the terminal equipment can take to stop or minimize the collection.
                </li>

            </ul>
            In addition Data Controllers have a responsibility to ensure that personal data is "processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing" (GDPR A.1(f))
            and "in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing" (GDPR Recital 39).
            This is directly applicable to the risk of delivery of malware onto user agents, especially when this results from the deliberate insertion of subresource elements within website content.

        </p>
        <p>
            Information about the potential tracking behaviour of resources can be delivered to the user within website content or by intrinsic user agent functionality.
            Websites can obtain the required information to do this relatively easily, whereas
            user agents can only present information gleaned from the automated examination of responses e.g. limited technical details about cookies and subresources.
            There is no standardised way for user agents alone to impart information that can only be known by an application's developers,
            such as the identity of the data controller(s) or of any data processors, their purposes for data collection and contracted relationships with other parties that may be present.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TPE enables information to be available at arbitrary times by specifying it in the Tracking Status Resource,
            or presented at the time consent is registered within parameters to the API.
        </p>
    </section>
<section>
    <h2>The need for changes to the existing TPE</h2>
    <p>
        The properties currently defined in the TSR need improvement in the following areas:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Purposes for Storage Use</strong><br />
                It is a requirement that the use of user agent storage, such as cookies or local Storage, is explained.
                Some purposes, such as that "strictly necessary to fulfil a service requested by the user", do not need consent,
                so it makes sense that the  information is presented at all times, not just when consent is registered. <br />
                User agents may wish to offer users privacy settings that would result in some storage being protected, e.g. "third-party cookies blocks",
                or allow the user to delete certain categories of non-exempted storage at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Controller Identity</strong><br />
                The existing "controller" property is a Url pointing to a human readable page that identifies the Data Controller, such as an About page.
                Any user agent UI presenting this information in a tabular or list form will need to acquire a simple string denoting the Data Controller's name,
                which is hard when all that is available is an unstructured HTML page.
                Furthermore, the GDPR requires that more detailed information about the Data Controller is provided,
                for example the contact details of the relevant Data Protection Officer.
                For these reasons it would be better to provide an object property in the TSR that can as a minimum supply a company's legal name,
                but that can also be extended with further fields, and these supplementary fields should be offered as non-normative examples. The TSR is again the post appropriate place to define these because,
                in situations where the GDPR applies, other legal bases than consent may be available.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Security</strong><br />
                User agents should be given the means to block sub-resources that could contain dangerous content, e.g. malware.
                Also sub-resources may allow third-party entities to collect and process a users personal data,
                or otherwise access user agent storage without the user's consent.
                Data Controllers can determine if the subresources they embed do not present dangers, or do not enable the collection of personal data.
                Similarly they know what third-party entities they have
                contracted with as Data Processors (service providers), which are not allowed to process data on their own behalf.
                The TSR would be the appropriate place for where these declarations should be made,
                because the information is equally valid when consent is not relied upon or registered.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Support for Out-Of-Band Consent</strong>
                The existing "config" property can be any arbitrary web page,
                which will diminish the possibilities to support User Control is situations where the Consent API is not supported.
                Some companies now support the self-regulatory Opt-out program by implementing
                a resource that signals when a user opts-out or revocation of their implied opt-in, causing the deletion of any unique user identifier.
                There is no standardised way for a user agent or user to determine the Url of this resource, so defining a suitable property in the TSR
                would improve functionality and possibilities for future innovation. There would of course be no point in supplying this information to a non-existent Consent API.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</section>
    <section>
        <h2>User agents are already able to act on information presented in the TSR</h2>
        <p>
            A site-wide tracking status resource provides information about the potential tracking behaviour of resources located at that origin server.
            For example, in the current TPE, a user agent might choose to exclude, or perform additional pre-flight verification of,
            requests to other domains that have not been claimed as same-party by the referring site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proposed ePrivacy Regulation will apply to user agent providers ("software providers permitting electronic communications"),
            where Article 10 requires them to help protect data stored there. In order to accurately recognise this data,
            and to minimise the need for arbitrary domain blocking and otherwise withdrawal of functionality,
            the TSR can be a useful conduit for web application declarations about data use.

            <h4>controllerDescription</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><em>controllerDescription</em></code> containing an array of objects representing one or more Data Controllers jointly responsible for an origin.
                If a <code><em>controllerDescription</em></code> exists it MUST contain a string property <code><em>name</em></code> indicating the legal name of the Data Controller entity.
                Additional optional properties are:

                        <code><em>about</em></code>
                        A URI for a human readable page describing the Data Controller. Equivalent to the existing "controller" property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code><embed>DPO</embed></code>
                        An object containing fields that identify the Data Protection Officer, the person who deals with Data Protection or Privacy issues for the controller

            <h4>otherParties</h4>
            <p>
                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><em>otherParties</em></code> containing an array of objects representing the domains
                of all resources that the controller has determined may be embedded by any resource with this origin.
                Each object contains a string <code><em>domain</em></code> indicating the URI authority name of an embedded party <em>target</em>,
                along with an optional <code><em>category</em></code> value of either "P", "N" or "S".
            </p>
            <p>
                A category of "P" indicates that the party owning the domain can receive personal data and has contracted with the origin server as a Data Processor.
                If the party owning the domain is known not to receive personal data from the interaction the code is "N".
                "S" indicates that the domain is managed by the site owner (i.e. one of the entities indicated by the "controllerDescription" array).
                Each embedded domain should contain a TSR with a "otherParties" property declaring its own expected embedded resources.
                This information can be used by browsers, browser extensions or script libraries to help protect user privacy by blocking, inhibiting or managing the actions
                of resources that are not so declared by the embedding site.

            <h4>declaredData</h4>
            <p>
                This is an object representing user agent storage employed by the origin server for tracking or other purposes.
                This gives the origin server the ability to transparently describe in a standardised way the overall retention time for client storage
                and the purpose and retention period for each storage item.
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY present this information
                to the user, and privacy regulators, audit services etc. will be able use website scanning tools to verify it.
                In addition Privacy Enhancing Technology components, such as TrackingBlocker or AdBlocker extensions,
                can make intelligent decisions regarding content blocking or storage removal when enforcing a user's privacy preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The object contains a long integer <code><em>overall_retention</em></code> a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of all the declared data.
                and an array of objects describing individual storage items controlled by the origin server.
                Each of these contains a <code><em>selector</em></code> string used to match the name or name-value pair of a particular item ,
                a string <code><embed>type</embed></code> representing the class of storage used where "C" is an HTTP cookie, "L" is local HTML5 storage, "I" is indexedDB,
                "E" is information stored in the browser cache such as "If-Then-Else/Etag" values, and "O" is any other form of storage.
                The <code><em>selector</em></code> string MAY contains a <code>=</code> character to demarcate between Regex match strings for the name and value of a name-value pair.
                The purposes for each item is encoded in the <code><em>purpose</em></code> array of objects.
                Each <code><em>purpose</em></code> object contains a short purpose identifier <code><em>code</em></code> and an option string <code><em>description</em></code> further describing the purpose.
                The <code><em>code</em></code> property MUST contain one or more of the following purpose identifiers.

                            If the same cookie name is also used as a UID tracking identifier then the <code><em>selector</em></code> must uniquely identify the opt-out case e.g.
                            <code>UID=opted-out</code>. A properly identified opt-out cookie MUST not be deleted by a user agent when other storage is deleted,
                            for example when the <code>overall_retention</code> period expires.

                The long integer <code><em>retention</em></code> contains a positive number of seconds indicating the maximum lifetime of the storage item.
                The optional array of strings <code><em>sharedWith</em></code> represents the main domains of any entities that this data item is shared with.

                An origin server MAY send a property named <code><em>deleteDataUri</em></code> indicating the URI (relative to the origin domain) of a resource
                that will delete all data held for this origin in the user agent.
                In many cases this would be the resource advertiser exchanges use for the self-regulatory Opt-out iframe.
