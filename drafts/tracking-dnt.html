      This specification defines the <a>DNT</a> request header field as an
      HTTP mechanism for expressing a user's preference regarding tracking,
      an HTML DOM property to make that expression readable by scripts, and
      APIs that allow scripts to register exceptions granted by
      the user. It also defines mechanisms for sites to communicate whether
      and how they honor a received preference, including
      well-known resources for retrieving preflight tracking status,
      a media type for representing tracking status information, and the
      <q>Tk</q> response header field for confirming tracking status.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The World Wide Web consists of billions of resources interconnected
      through the use of hypertext. Hypertext provides a simple, page-oriented
      view of the information provided by those resources, which can be
      traversed by selecting links, manipulating controls, and supplying data
      via forms and search dialogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Web page is often composed of many information sources beyond the
      initial resource request, including embedded references to stylesheets,
      inline images, javascript, and other elements that might be
      automatically requested as part of the rendering or behavioral
      processing defined for that page. The user's experience is seamless,
      even if the page has been composed from the results of many network
      interactions with multiple servers. From the user's perspective, they
      are simply visiting and interacting with a single Web site: all of the
      technical details and protocol mechanisms used to compose a page to
      represent that site are hidden behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web site owners often collect data regarding usage of their sites, for a
      variety of purposes, including what led a user to visit the site
      (<dfn>referrals</dfn>), how effective the user experience is within the
      site (<dfn>web analytics</dfn>), and the nature of who is using the
      site (<dfn>audience segmentation</dfn>).
      In some cases, the data collected is used to dynamically adapt content
      (<dfn>personalization</dfn>) or advertising presented to the user
      (<dfn>targeted advertising</dfn>). Data collection often occurs through
      insertion of embedded elements on each page, resulting in a stream of
      data that connects a user's activity across multiple pages. A survey of
      these techniques and their privacy implications can be found in
      [[KnowPrivacy]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Users need a mechanism to express their own preferences regarding
      <a>tracking</a> that is both simple to configure and efficient when
      implemented. However, merely expressing a preference does not imply that
      all recipients will comply. In some cases, a server might be dependent
      on some forms of tracking and unwilling or unable to turn that off.
      In other cases, a server might perform only limited forms of tracking
      that would be acceptable to most users. Therefore, servers need
      mechanisms for communicating their own tracking behavior, requesting
      consent, and storing a <a>user-granted exception</a> once the user has
      made an informed choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification extends Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) semantics
      [[!RFC7231]] to communicate a user's tracking preference, if any, and an
      origin server's tracking behavior. The <a>DNT</a> request header field
      is defined for communicating the user's tracking preference for the
      <a>target resource</a>. A well-known URI for a
      <a href="#status-resource">tracking status resource</a> and the
      <a>Tk</a> response header field are defined for communicating the
      server's tracking behavior. In addition, JavaScript APIs are defined for
      enabling scripts to determine DNT status and register a user-granted
      exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification does not define requirements on what a recipient
      needs to do to comply with a user's expressed tracking preference,
      except for the means by which such compliance is communicated. Instead,
      the tracking status provides the ability to identify a set of compliance
      regimes to which the server claims to comply, with the assumption being
      that each regime defines its own requirements on compliant behavior.
      For example, [[TCS]] is a work-in-progress that intends to define such a
      compliance regime.

    <section id='terminology.activity'>
      <h3>Activity</h3>

      <p>
        <dfn>Tracking</dfn> is the collection of data regarding a particular
        user's activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention,
        use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the
        context in which it occurred.
        A <dfn>context</dfn> is a set of resources that are controlled by
        the same party or jointly controlled by a set of parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>network interaction</dfn> is a single HTTP request and its
        corresponding response(s): zero or more interim (1xx) responses and
        a single final (2xx-5xx) response.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>user action</dfn> is a deliberate action by the user, via
        configuration, invocation, or selection, to initiate a network
        interaction. Selection of a link, submission of a form, and
        reloading a page are examples of user actions.
        <dfn>User activity</dfn> is any set of such user actions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='terminology.participants'>
      <h3>Participants</h3>

      <p>
        A <dfn>user</dfn> is a natural person who is making, or has made,
        use of the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>party</dfn> is a natural person, a legal entity, or a set of
        legal entities that share common owner(s), common controller(s), and
        a group identity that is easily discoverable by a user. Common
        branding or providing a list of affiliates that is available via a
        link from a resource where a party describes DNT practices are
        examples of ways to provide this discoverability.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to a given user action, a <dfn>first party</dfn>
        is a party with which the user intends to interact, via one or more
        network interactions, as a result of making that action. Merely
        hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content
        does not constitute a user's intent to interact with another party.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a resource on the Web will be jointly controlled by
        two or more distinct parties. Each of those parties is considered a
        first party if a user would reasonably expect to communicate with
        all of them when accessing that resource. For example, prominent
        co-branding on the resource might lead a user to expect that
        multiple parties are responsible for the content or functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any data collected as a result of one or more network
        interactions resulting from a user's action,
        a <dfn>third party</dfn> is any party other than that user, a first
        party for that user action, or a service provider acting on behalf
        of either that user or that first party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to Web resources often involves multiple parties that might
        process the data received in a network interaction. For example,
        domain name services, network access points, content distribution
        networks, load balancing services, security filters, cloud
        platforms, and software-as-a-service providers might be a party to a
        given network interaction because they are contracted by either the
        user or the resource owner to provide the mechanisms for
        communication. Likewise, additional parties might be engaged after a
        network interaction, such as when services or contractors are used
        to perform specialized data analysis or records retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the data received in a given network interaction, a
        <dfn>service provider</dfn> is considered to be the same party as
        its <dfn>contractee</dfn> if the service provider:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>processes the data on behalf of the contractee;</li>
        <li>ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as
            directed by the contractee;</li>
        <li>has no independent right to use the data other than in a
            <a>permanently de-identified</a> form (e.g., for monitoring
            service integrity, load balancing, capacity planning, or
            billing); and,</li>
        <li>has a contract in place with the contractee which is consistent
            with the above limitations.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id='terminology.data'>
      <h3>Data</h3>

      <p>
        A party <dfn>collects</dfn> data received in a network interaction
        if that data remains within the party’s control after the network
        interaction is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        A party <dfn>uses</dfn> data if the party processes the data for any
        purpose other than storage or merely forwarding it to another party.
      </p>
      <p>
        A party <dfn>shares</dfn> data if it transfers or provides a copy of
        that data to any other party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is <dfn>permanently de-identified</dfn> when there exists a
        high level of confidence that no human subject of the data can be
        identified, directly or indirectly (e.g., via association with an
        identifier, user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
        combination with other retained or available information.

    <h2>Determining User Preference</h2>

    <p>
      The goal of this protocol is to allow a user to express their
      personal preference regarding tracking to each server and
      web application that they communicate with via HTTP, thereby allowing
      recipients of that preference to adjust tracking behavior accordingly
      or to reach a separate agreement with the user that satisfies all
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key to that notion of expression is that the signal sent MUST reflect
      the user's preference, not the choice of some vendor, institution,
      site, or network-imposed mechanism outside the user's control;
      this applies equally to both the general preference and exceptions.
      The basic principle is that a tracking preference expression is only
      transmitted when it reflects a deliberate choice by the user. In the
      absence of user choice, there is no tracking preference expressed
      (see <a href="#privacy.not-preconfigured" class="sectionRef"></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent MUST offer users a minimum of two alternative choices
      for a <q>Do Not Track</q> preference: <code><dfn>unset</dfn></code> or
      <code><dfn>DNT:1</dfn></code>.
      A user agent MAY offer a third alternative choice: <code><dfn>DNT:0</dfn></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user's choice is <a>DNT:1</a> or <a>DNT:0</a>, the
      tracking preference is <dfn>enabled</dfn>; otherwise, the
      tracking preference is <dfn>not enabled</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent MUST have a default tracking preference of
      <code>unset</code> (not enabled) unless a specific tracking preference
      is implied by the user's decision to use that agent. For example, use
      of a general-purpose browser would not imply a tracking preference
      when invoked normally as <q>SuperFred</q>, but might imply a
      preference if invoked as <q>SuperDoNotTrack</q> or
      <q>UltraPrivacyFred</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations of HTTP that are not under control of the user
      MUST NOT add, delete, or modify a tracking preference.
      Some controlled network environments, such as public access
      terminals or managed corporate intranets, might impose restrictions
      on the use or configuration of installed user agents, such that a
      user might only have access to user agents with a predetermined
      preference enabled.  However, if a user brings their
      own Web-enabled device to a library or cafe with wireless Internet
      access, the expectation will be that their chosen user agent and
      personal preferences regarding Web site behavior will not be
      altered by the network environment (aside from blanket limitations
      on what resources can or cannot be accessed through that network).
    </p>
    <p>
      An HTTP intermediary MUST NOT add, delete, or modify a tracking
      preference expression in a request forwarded through that intermediary
      unless the intermediary has been specifically installed or configured
      to do so by the user making the request. For example, an Internet
      Service Provider MUST NOT inject <a>DNT:1</a> on behalf
      of all users who have not expressed a preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      User agents often include user-installable <dfn>extensions</dfn>, also
      known as <dfn>add-ons</dfn> or <dfn>plug-ins</dfn>, that are
      capable of modifying configurations and making network requests. From
      the user's perspective, these extensions are considered part of the
      user agent and ought to respect the user's configuration of a tracking
      preference. The user agent as a whole is responsible for ensuring
      conformance with this protocol, to the extent possible, which means
      the user agent core and each extension are jointly responsible for
      conformance. However, there is no single standard for extension
      interfaces. A user agent that permits such extensions SHOULD provide
      an appropriate mechanism for extensions to determine the user's
      tracking preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent extension MUST NOT alter the tracking preference
      expression or its associated configuration unless the act of
      installing and enabling that extension is an explicit choice by the
      user for that tracking preference, or the extension itself complies
      with all of the requirements this protocol places on a user agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, software outside of the user agent might filter network
      traffic or cause a user agent's configuration to be changed.
      Software that alters a user agent configuration MUST adhere to the
      above requirements on a user agent extension. Software that filters
      network traffic MUST adhere to the above requirements on an HTTP
      intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the above requirements, we do not specify how the tracking
      preference choices are offered to the user or how the preference is
      enabled: each implementation is responsible for determining the user
      experience by which a tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a user might select a check-box in their user agent's
      configuration, install an extension that is specifically
      designed to add a tracking preference expression,
      or make a choice for privacy that then implicitly includes a
      tracking preference (e.g., <q>Privacy settings: high</q>).
      A user agent might ask the user for their preference during startup,
      perhaps on first use or after an update adds the tracking protection
      feature. Likewise, a user might install or configure a proxy to add
      the expression to their own outgoing requests.

    <h2>Expressing a Tracking Preference</h2>

    <section id='expression-format'>
      <h3>Expression Format</h3>
      <p>
        When a user has <a>enabled</a> a tracking preference, that
        preference needs to be expressed to all mechanisms that might
        perform or initiate <a>tracking</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a>enabled</a>, a tracking preference is expressed as either:
      </p>
      <table class="simple">
        <tr><th>DNT</th>
            <th>meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>1</td>
            <td>This user prefers not to be tracked on this request.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>0</td>
            <td>This user prefers to allow tracking on this request.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST NOT send a tracking preference expression if
        a tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>.  This means that no
        expression is sent for each of the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the user agent does not implement this protocol;</li>
        <li>the user has not yet made a choice for a specific preference;
            or,</li>
        <li>the user has chosen not to transmit a preference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, servers
        MAY interpret the lack of an expressed tracking preference as they
        find most appropriate for the given user, particularly when
        considered in light of the user's privacy expectations and cultural
        circumstances. Likewise, servers might make use of other preference
        information outside the scope of this protocol, such as
        site-specific user preferences or third-party registration services,
        to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit preference is
        expressed via this protocol.

      <h3>DNT Header Field for HTTP Requests</h3>

      <p>
        The <code><dfn>DNT</dfn></code> header field is a mechanism for expressing the
        user's tracking preference in an HTTP request ([[!RFC7230]]).
        At most one <code>DNT</code> header field can be present in a valid request.
      </p>
<pre class="abnf">
DNT-field-name  = "DNT"
DNT-field-value = ( "0" / "1" ) *DNT-extension
</pre>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field if the
        user's tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST generate a <code>DNT</code> header field with a
        field-value that begins with the numeric character "1" if the user's
        tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>, their preference is for
        <a>DNT:1</a>, and no exception has been granted for the
        target resource (see <a href="#exceptions" class="sectionRef"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST generate a <code>DNT</code> header field with a
        field-value that begins with the numeric character "0" if the user's
        tracking preference is <a>enabled</a> and their preference is for
        <a>DNT:0</a>, or if an exception has been granted for
        the target resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proxy MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field unless it has
        been specifically installed or configured to do so by the user
        making the request and adheres to the above requirements as if it
        were a user agent.
      </p>

      <section id='dnt-extensions'>
        <h4>Extensions to the DNT Field Value</h4>

        <p>
          The remainder of the <a>DNT</a> field-value, after the initial character,
          is reserved for future extensions. DNT extensions can only be
          transmitted when a tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>.
          The extension syntax is restricted to visible ASCII characters that
          can be parsed as a single word in HTTP and safely embedded in a
          JSON string without further encoding
          (<a href="#status-representation" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
DNT-extension   = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-5B / %x5D-7E
                ; excludes CTL, SP, DQUOTE, comma, backslash
</pre>
        <p>
          For example, additional characters might indicate modifiers to the
          main preference expressed by the first digit, such that the main
          preference will be understood if the recipient does not understand
          the extension. Hence, a field-value of "1xyz" can be thought of
          as <q>do not track, but if you understand the refinements defined
          by x, y, or z, then adjust my preferences according to those
          refinements.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents that do not implement DNT extensions MUST NOT send
          DNT-extension characters in the <a>DNT</a> field-value.
          Servers that do not implement DNT extensions SHOULD ignore
          anything beyond the first character.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This DNT-extension feature is speculative because no known
          extensions have been defined; implementers that do not read this
          specification are likely to assume that DNT only has the
          fixed values of "0" or "1". Furthermore, the potential benefits
          of this mechanism are unclear given that extension information
          could be supplied using separate request header fields.
          Inappropriate extensions to the "1" value might cause the user's
          requests to be more easily

      <h3>JavaScript Property to Detect Preference</h3>

      <p>
        The <code><dfn>Navigator.doNotTrack</dfn></code> property enables
        a client-side script with read access to the
        <code><dfn data-cite="!HTML5#navigator">Navigator</dfn></code> object
        [[!HTML5]] to determine what <a>DNT</a> header field value would be
        sent to the <a>effective script origin</a>, taking into account the
        user's general preference (if any) and user-granted exceptions
        applicable to the <a>target domain</a> when referenced by the
        active document's <a>top-level browsing context</a>.
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface Navigator {
            readonly attribute DOMString? doNotTrack;
        };
      </pre>
      <p>
        The value is <code>null</code> if no DNT header field would be
        sent (e.g., because a tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>
        and no user-granted exception is applicable);
        otherwise, the value is a string beginning with "0" or "1",
        possibly followed by DNT-extension characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, the value of <a>Navigator.doNotTrack</a> for a given
        script is either <code>null</code> or the string value that would be
        sent in a <a>DNT</a> field-value
        (<a href="#dnt-header-field" class="sectionRef"></a>)
        in a request to a <a>target resource</a> at the
        <a>effective script origin</a> (the current <a>document.domain</a> of
        the script's <a>responsible document</a>) when that request is due to
        an embedded reference from this site (the <a>document.domain</a> of
        the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, the value of <a>Navigator.doNotTrack</a> ought to reflect
        the current set of user-granted exceptions in effect when the
        attribute is read. In practice, however, the value might only reflect
        the value that was in effect when the script was initiated.

      <h3>Tracking Preference Expressed in Other Protocols</h3>

      <p>
        A user's tracking preference is intended to apply in general,
        regardless of the protocols being used for Internet communication.
        However, it is beyond the scope of this specification to define how
        a user's tracking preference might be communicated via protocols
        other than HTTP.

    <h2>User-Granted Exceptions</h2>

    <section id="exception-overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        Content providers might wish to prompt visitors to <q>opt in</q> to
        tracking for behavioral advertising or similar purposes when they
        arrive with the Do Not Track setting enabled. However, granting an
        exception in one context (e.g., while browsing a news site) does not
        imply that exception is applicable to other contexts (e.g., browsing
        an unrelated medical site). Furthermore, users might wish to view or
        edit all the exceptions they've granted in a single, consistent user
        interface, rather than managing preferences in a different way on
        every content provider or tracker's privacy page.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>user-granted exception</dfn> is the record of a decision by
        the user to grant consent for tracking (<a>DNT:0</a>) on future
        requests from a given site to a set of target domains.
        Both site and target are scoped by domain, similar to the existing
        domain scope of cookies
        (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#relaxing-the-same-origin-restriction">Section 5.3.1</a>
        of [[!HTML5]]), to avoid prompting the user for every subdomain of a
        site and every target resource that might be referenced.
      </p>
      <p>
        A client-side database can be used for persistent storage of
        user-granted exceptions, such that permission to send <a>DNT:0</a>
        is obtained by a site and stored via a JavaScript API. However, we
        only define the API (below); the choice of storage mechanism is left
        to each implementation. In comparison to the use of cookies to manage
        consent, an exception database and APIs provide more transparency and
        better user control, while also providing better persistence of those
        exceptions for sites.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="exception-scope">
      <h3>Site-specific or Web-wide</h3>

      <p>
        There are two primary domain concepts involved
        in the processing of user-granted exceptions:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>site domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>the domain associated with a site on which a given reference
          might be found and for which the user-granted
          exceptions API might be queried: specifically, the current
          <a>document.domain</a> of the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s
          <a>active document</a> [[!HTML5]].</dd>
        <dt><dfn>target domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>the <a>uri-host</a> subcomponent of the <a>authority</a> component
          of a referenced "http" or "https" URI [[!RFC7230]].</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A user-granted exception is <dfn>site-specific</dfn> if the exception
        is limited to requests embedded in, or referred by, a given
        <a>site domain</a>; otherwise, the exception is <dfn>web-wide</dfn>
        because it applies to the target domain regardless of the referring
        site. For example, a user might wish to grant a certain target domain
        a web-wide exception for the purpose of audience measurement across
        multiple sites, perhaps in exchange for some incentive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asking for consent to record a <a>site-specific</a> exception,
        a site might make some claims regarding limitations on the actions and
        behavior of the known third parties that it references. Such a site
        might wish to restrict its <a>site-specific</a> exceptions to only
        target domains for which those claims have been verified.
        (For example, consider the dilemma of a site that has trusted
        advertisers and analytics providers, along with some less trusted
        mashed-up content that might reference other sites). For this reason,
        <a>site-specific</a> exceptions can either be limited to a named set of
        target domains or be applicable to any target domain ("*").
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='exception-granting'>
      <h3>Granting an Exception</h3>

      <p>
        It is expected that a site will explain to the user, in its online
        content, the need for an exception and the consequences of granting or
        denying that exception. Upon receipt of an informed consent from the
        user, a script operating on the site's page is expected to
        promise-call the <a>Navigator.storeTrackingException</a> API using
        parameters consistent with the consent granted by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MUST ensure that a call to store an exception reflects the
        user's intention to grant an exception at the time of that call. It
        is the sole responsibility of the site to determine that a call to
        record an exception reflects the user's informed consent at the
        time of that call.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third party target domains that might wish to receive a user-granted
        exception often do not have the ability to invoke an interactive
        JavaScript presence on a page (for example, those that provide only
        images or "tracking pixels"). They cannot request an exception under
        these circumstances, either because a script is needed to make the
        API call or it requires interaction to ensure the user is informed
        and to receive an indication of their consent. In general, this
        process of informing, getting consent, and calling the API is not
        expected within page elements where such trackers are invoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        A first party site's page (the <a>top-level browsing context</a>)
        might be used to obtain <a>site-specific</a> consent for multiple
        parties;
        e.g., using multiple iframe elements containing scripts that can
        convey information about each party's policies and obtain specific
        consent for each party. In this case, the <a>effective script origin</a>
        might be different from the site for which consent is being granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, a third party might encourage the user to visit their
        own site directly in order to engage in a consent dialog and make use
        of the API to store a <a>web-wide</a> exception.
        A <a>web-wide</a> exception can only be stored via the API when
        interacting with the web-wide target domain directly as a
        <a>first party</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A site can request an exception be stored even when the user's
        general preference is <a>not enabled</a>. This permits the sending of
        <a>DNT</a> only for target resources for which an expressed
        preference is desired. Stored exceptions could affect which
        preference is transmitted if a user later chooses to configure a
        general tracking preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent might not store the exception immediately, possibly
        because it is allowing the user to confirm. Even though the site has
        acquired the user's informed consent before calling the store API,
        it is possible that the user will change their mind, allow the
        storing of an exception to proceed but later remove it, or perhaps
        deny the storage by prior configuration.
        Nonetheless, at the time of a call, the site has acquired the
        user's consent and can proceed on that basis whether or not the
        user agent has stored an exception.

      <h3>Checking for an Exception</h3>

      <p>
        A site can promise-call the <a>Navigator.trackingExceptionExists</a>
        API to enquire whether an exception has been granted and stands in
        the user agent. If it resolves to false (the exception has expired,
        been deleted, or has not yet been stored), the user can be asked
        again for consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent is expected to query the exceptions database at the
        time of a request in order to determine what value (if any) to send
        as the user's tracking preference.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>While the user is browsing a given site,
          if the duplet [<a>site domain</a>, <a>target domain</a>] matches
          any duplet in the database, then a <a>DNT:0</a> preference is sent,
          otherwise the user’s general preference is sent (if any).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A pair of duplets [A,B] and [X,Y] match if A matches X and B matches Y.
        A pair of values A and X match if and only if one of the following
        is true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>either A or X is "*";</li>
        <li>A and X are the same string;</li>
        <li>A has the form '*.domain' and X is 'domain' or is of the form
          'string.domain', where 'string' is any sequence of characters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="example">
        For example, a user might grant an exception for metrics.example.net
        to track their activity on news.example.com and weather.example.com,
        but not on medical.example.org. If the document at
        <code>http://news.example.com/news/story/2098373.html</code>
        has embedded references to
        <code>http://metrics.example.net/1x1.gif</code> and
        <code>http://weather.example.com/widget.js</code>, the
        site domain for those references is
        <code>news.example.com</code> and the target domains are
        <code>metrics.example.net</code> and
        <code>weather.example.com</code>, respectively. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MAY choose to disregard a user-granted exception when
        the <a>target resource</a> does not have a corresponding tracking
        status resource with a valid tracking status representation, since
        that would imply the <a>target resource</a> does not conform to this
        specification.

      <h3>Revoking an Exception</h3>

      <p>
        A site that stores exceptions is also expected to enable revocation
        of those exceptions. The <a>Navigator.removeTrackingException</a> API
        can be promise-called by a script to remove all exceptions applicable
        to that site.
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MAY monitor for changes to its user-granted exceptions.
        If a user revokes consent by deleting an exception, the site MUST
        respect that revocation, though it MAY ask again for a new
        exception. In other words, a site MUST NOT resurrect a deleted
        exception without first interacting with and receiving new 
        consent from the user.

                If a user agent presents these properties to the user, it ought to

                In addition to the data above, a user agent might also store

                the <a>effective script origin</a>, a current timestamp, or other

                <a href="#status-representation">tracking status representation</a>
                that includes a <a>policy</a> property.
                This allows a user agent to obtain and possibly store additional
                information about the calling site’s controller and tracking
                policies at the time an exception is granted.
            </p>
            <p>
                A user agent MAY reject the promise with a <a>DOMException</a>
                named "InvalidStateError" if it cannot determine the
                <a>effective script origin</a> or if the site corresponding to that

            <p>
                For a <a>site-specific</a> exception,

                if the script's <a>effective script origin</a> would not be able

                following the cookie domain rules [[!RFC6265]],
            </p>
            <p class="example">
                For example, a script on <em>www.foo.bar.example.com</em> can set

                <code>"bar.example.com"</code> or

                <code>"something.else.example.com"</code> or <code>"com"</code>.
            </p>
            <p>

                <a>document.domain</a> of the script's <a>responsible document</a>
                [[!HTML5]]. This effectively limits the API for web-wide exceptions
                to the single <a>effective script origin</a> domain of the caller.
            </p>
            <p>
                For any other failure, such as an incorrectly formatted parameter in
                the <a>TrackingExData</a>, the user agent MUST NOT store
                any of the target duplets in the database and MUST reject the promise

            <p>
                <a>Upon fulfillment</a>, the user agent has added to its local

            <p class="note" id="api-security">
                There are some security concerns here regarding the ability of a
                script with an <a>effective script origin</a> different from the
                site being able to set site-specific exceptions that might impact
                the behavior of that site. Likewise, it might be unwise for a script
                to be able to impact the DNT values received by target domains when
                the <a>effective script origin</a> differs from those targets.
                However, a solution to these concerns would require additional
                requests to verify that the <a>effective script origin</a> has the
                right to set DNT for the given duplets, which is overkill given how
                little value is obtained by setting the field without a legitimate
                record of consent having been received.<br />
                <br />
                This design is consistent with the fact that there is no technical
                restraint from sites calling the API without having first obtained
                an informed consent from the user. What we are assuming is that the
                surrounding regulatory environment will be sufficient to punish
                those who might misuse the API or abuse the scope of stored
                exceptions.

    <h2>Communicating a Tracking Status</h2>

    <section id='response-overview'>
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        In addition to expressing the user's preference regarding tracking,
        this protocol enables servers to communicate machine-readable claims
        regarding their own tracking behavior. Since a personalized tracking
        status on every response would disable caching, a combination of
        response mechanisms are defined to allow the tracking status to be
        communicated prior to making a trackable request and without making
        every response dynamic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='tracking-status-value'>
      <h3>Tracking Status Value</h3>

      <section id='TSV-defn'>
        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>
          A <dfn>tracking status value</dfn> (<dfn>TSV</dfn>) is a single
          character response to the user's tracking preference with regard to
          data collected via the <dfn>designated resource</dfn>.
          For a site-wide tracking status resource, the designated resource
          is any resource on the same origin server.
          For a <a>Tk</a> response header field, the <a>target resource</a> of the
          corresponding request is the designated resource, and remains so
          for any subsequent request-specific tracking status resource
          referred to by the Tk field value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tracking status value is case sensitive, as defined formally
          by the following ABNF.
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
TSV    = %x21   ; "!" — under construction
       / %x3F   ; "?" — dynamic
       / %x47   ; "G" — gateway to multiple parties
       / %x4E   ; "N" — not tracking
       / %x54   ; "T" — tracking
       / %x43   ; "C" — tracking with consent
       / %x50   ; "P" — tracking only if consented

       / %x55   ; "U" — updated
       / TSV-extension
</pre>
      </section>

      <section id='TSV-!'>
        <h4>Under Construction (!)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>!</dfn></code> means that the origin
          server is currently testing its communication of tracking status.
          The <code>!</code> value has been provided to ease testing and
          deployment on production systems during the initial periods of
          testing compliance and during adjustment periods due to future
          protocol changes or shifting regulatory constraints. Note that
          this value does not indicate that the user's preference will be
          ignored, nor that tracking will occur as a result of accessing
          the designated resource.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='TSV-?'>
        <h4>Dynamic (?)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>?</dfn></code> means the origin server
          needs more information to determine tracking status, usually
          because the <a>designated resource</a> dynamically adjusts
          behavior based on information in a request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <code>?</code> is present in the site-wide tracking status,
          the origin server MUST send a <a>Tk</a> header field in all
          responses to requests on the designated resource.
          If <code>?</code> is present in the <a>Tk</a> header field,
          more information will be provided in a request-specific
          tracking status resource referred to by the <a>status-id</a>.
          An origin server MUST NOT send <code>?</code> as the
          tracking status value in the representation of a
          request-specific tracking status resource.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='TSV-G'>
        <h4>Gateway (G)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>G</dfn></code> means the server
          is acting as a gateway to an exchange involving multiple parties.
          This might occur if a response to the <a>designated resource</a>
          involves an automated selection process, such as dynamic bidding,
          where the party that is selected determines how the request data
          will be treated with respect to an expressed tracking preference.
          Similar to the <a>?</a> value, the <code>G</code> TSV
          indicates that the actual tracking status is dynamic and will be
          provided in the response message's <a>Tk</a> header field,
          presumably using information forwarded from the selected party.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tracking status value is only valid as a site-wide status.
          A server MUST NOT send <code>G</code> as the
          tracking status value in a <a>Tk</a> header field or within the
          representation of a request-specific tracking status resource.

        <ul>
          <li>the gateway MUST send a link within its site-wide
            tracking status representation to a privacy policy that
            explains what limitations are placed on parties that
            might receive data via that gateway;</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST forward any expressed tracking
            preference in the request to each party that receives data
            from that request;</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST have a contract in place with each of the
            parties to whom it provides request data such that only the
            selected party is allowed to retain tracking data from a
            request with an expressed tracking preference of
            <a>DNT:1</a>; and,</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST send a <a>Tk</a> header field in
            responses to requests on the designated resource and include
            within that field's value a <a>status-id</a>
            specific to the selected party, such that information about
            the selected party can be obtained via the request-specific
            tracking status resource (see
            <a href="#request-specific-status-resource" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With respect to tracking performed by the gateway itself, the
          <code>G</code> response can be considered equivalent
          to the <a>T</a> (tracking) response defined below.
          The other information within the site-wide tracking status
          representation indicates how the gateway intends to comply
          with an expressed tracking preference, aside from the potential
          sharing of data implied by the gateway process.

        <h4>Consent (C)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>C</dfn></code> means that the origin
          server believes it has received prior consent for tracking this
          user, user agent, or device, perhaps via some mechanism not
          defined by this specification, and that prior consent overrides
          the tracking preference expressed by this protocol.
          An origin server that sends the <code>C</code> tracking status
          value for a <a>designated resource</a> MUST provide a reference
          for controlling consent within the <a>config</a>
          property of its corresponding tracking status representation

        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>P</dfn></code> means that the origin
          server does not know, in real-time, whether it has received prior
          consent for tracking this user, user agent, or device, but
          promises not to use or share any <a>DNT:1</a> data

          received for which such consent has not been received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this status value does not itself indicate whether a
          specific request is tracked, an origin server that sends a
          <code>P</code> tracking status value MUST provide a
          <a>config</a> property in the corresponding tracking
          status representation that links to a resource for obtaining
          consent status.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>P</code> tracking status value is specifically meant to
          address audience survey systems for which determining consent at
          the time of a request is either impractical, due to legacy systems
          not being able to keep up with Web traffic, or potentially "gamed"
          by first party sites if they can determine which of their users
          have consented. The data cannot be used for the sake of
          personalization. If consent can be determined at the time of a
          request, the <a>C</a> tracking status is preferred.

          server is unable or unwilling to respect a tracking preference
          received from the requesting user agent.  An origin server that
          sends the <code>D</code> tracking status value MUST detail within
          the server's corresponding privacy policy the conditions under
          which a tracking preference might be disregarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an origin server might disregard the DNT field
          received from specific user agents (or via specific network
          intermediaries) that are deemed to be non-conforming, might be
          collecting additional data from specific source network
          locations due to prior security incidents, or might be

          exception to normal behavior. If this turns out not to be the

      <h3>Tk Header Field for HTTP Responses</h3>

      <section id='Tk-header-defn'>
        <h4>Definition</h4>

        <p>
          The <code><dfn>Tk</dfn></code> response header field is a means for indicating
          the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request.
          An origin server is REQUIRED to send a <code>Tk</code> header
          field if its site-wide tracking status value is <a>?</a>
          (dynamic) or <a>G</a> (gateway), or when an interactive change is
          made to the tracking status and indicated by <a>U</a> (updated).
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
Tk-field-name   =  "Tk"
Tk-field-value  =  TSV [ ";" status-id ]
</pre>
        <p>
          The Tk field-value begins with a tracking status value
          (<a href="#tracking-status-value" class="sectionRef"></a>),
          optionally followed by a semicolon and a <code>status-id</code>
          that refers to a request-specific tracking status resource
          (<a href="#referring-status-id" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a Tk header field for a resource that claims not to
          be tracking would look like:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">Tk: N</pre>
      </section>

      <section id='referring-status-id'>
        <h4>Referring to a Request-specific Tracking Status Resource</h4>
        <p>
          If an origin server has multiple, request-specific tracking
          policies, such that the tracking status might differ depending on
          some aspect of the request (e.g., method, <a>target resource</a>, header
          fields, data, etc.), the origin server can provide an additional
          subtree of well-known resources corresponding to each of those
          distinct tracking statuses. The <code><dfn>status-id</dfn></code>
          portion of the <code>Tk</code> field-value indicates which specific
          tracking status resource applies to the current request.
          The <code>status-id</code> is case-sensitive.
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
status-id       =  1*id-char
id-char         =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / "+" / "=" / "/"
</pre>
        <p>
          For example, a response containing
        </p>
        <pre class="example">Tk: T;fRx42</pre>
        <p>
          indicates that data collected via the target resource might be
          used for tracking and that an applicable tracking status
          representation can be obtained by performing a retrieval request
          on
        </p>
        <pre>/.well-known/dnt/fRx42</pre>
        <p>
          Note that the <code>status-id</code> is resolved relative
          to the origin server of the current request.  A retrieval request
          targeting that URI can be redirected, if desired, to some other
          server.  The <code>status-id</code> has been intentionally limited
          to a small set of characters to encourage use of short tokens
          instead of potentially long, human-readable strings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a Tk field-value has a tracking status value of
          <a>?</a> (dynamic), the origin server MUST
          send a <code>status-id</code> in the field-value.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='interactive-status-change'>
        <h4>Indicating an Interactive Status Change</h4>
        <p>
          Interactive mechanisms might be used, beyond
          the scope of this specification, that have the effect of asking
          for and obtaining prior consent for tracking, or for modifying
          prior indications of consent.  For example, the tracking status
          resource's status object defines a <a>config</a>
          property that can refer to such a mechanism. Although such
          out-of-band mechanisms are not defined by this specification,
          their presence might influence the tracking status object's
          response value.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an origin server provides a mechanism via HTTP for
          establishing or modifying out-of-band tracking preferences,
          the origin server MUST indicate within the mechanism's response
          when a state-changing request has resulted in a change to the
          tracking status for that server.  This indication of an
          interactive status change is accomplished by sending a
          <a>Tk</a> header field in the response with a tracking status
          value of <a>U</a> (updated).

      <section id='site-wide-status-resource'>
        <h4>Site-wide Tracking Status</h4>
        <p>
          A <dfn>site-wide tracking status resource</dfn> provides
          information about the potential tracking behavior of resources
          located at that origin server. A site-wide tracking status
          resource has the well-known identifier
        </p>
        <pre>/.well-known/dnt/</pre>
        <p>
          relative to the origin server's URI [[RFC5785]].
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server that receives a valid <code>GET</code> request
          targeting its site-wide tracking status resource MUST send either
          a successful response containing a machine-readable representation
          of the site-wide tracking status, as defined below, or a sequence
          of redirects that leads to such a representation. Failure to
          provide access to such a representation implies that the
          origin server does not implement this protocol.
          The representation can be cached, as described
          in <a href="#status-caching" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="#use-cases" class="sectionRef"></a> for

          some aspect of the request (e.g., method, target resource, header
          fields, data, etc.), the origin server can provide an additional

        <p>
          Resources within the request-specific tracking status resource

      <section id='status-checks-not-tracked'>
        <h4>Status Checks are Not Tracked</h4>
        <p>
          When sending a request for the tracking status, a user agent
          SHOULD include any cookie data [[RFC6265]] (set prior to the
          request) that would be sent in a normal request to that origin
          server, since that data might be needed by the server to determine
          the current tracking status. For example, the cookie data might
          indicate a prior out-of-band decision by the user to opt-out or
          consent to tracking by that origin server.
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MUST NOT retain tracking data regarding requests
          on the site-wide tracking status resource or within the tracking
          status resource space, regardless of the presence, absence, or
          value of a DNT header field, cookies, or any other information in
          the request.
          In addition, an origin server MUST NOT send Set-Cookie or
          Set-Cookie2 header fields in responses to those requests,
          including the responses to redirected tracking status requests,
          and MUST NOT send a response having content that initiates
          tracking beyond what was already present in the request.
          A user agent SHOULD ignore, or treat as an error, any Set-Cookie
          or Set-Cookie2 header field received in such a response.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='status-caching'>
        <h4>Caching</h4>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is applicable to all users, regardless of
          the received <a>DNT</a> field-value and other data received via the
          request, then the origin server SHOULD mark the response as
          cacheable [[!RFC7234]] and assign a time-to-live (expiration or
          max-use) that is sufficient to enable shared caching but not
          greater than the earliest point at which the service's tracking
          behavior might increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if the tracking status response is set to expire in
          seven days, then the earliest point in time that the service's
          tracking behavior can be increased is seven days after the
          tracking status representation has been
          updated to reflect the new behavior, since old copies might
          persist in caches until the expiration is triggered. A service's
          tracking behavior can be reduced at any time, with or without a
          corresponding change to the tracking status resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is only applicable to users that have
          the same <a>DNT</a> field-value, the origin server MUST send a
          Vary header field that includes "DNT" in its field-value or a
          Cache-Control header field containing one of the following
          directives: "private", "no-cache", "no-store", or "max-age=0".
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is only applicable to the specific user
          that requested it, then the origin server MUST send a
          Cache-Control header field containing one of the following
          directives: "private", "no-cache", or "no-store".
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of the cache-control settings, it is expected that
          user agents will check the tracking status of a service only once
          per session (at most).  A public Internet site that intends to
          change its tracking status to increase tracking behavior MUST
          update the tracking status resource in accordance with that
          planned behavior at least twenty-four hours prior to activating
          that new behavior on the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent that adjusts behavior based on active verification
          of tracking status, relying on cached tracking status responses
          to do so, SHOULD check responses to its state-changing requests

        This media type consists of a <a>status object</a>

          A tracking status representation consists of a single
          <dfn>status object</dfn> containing properties that
          describe the tracking status applicable to the
          <a>designated resource</a>.  Most of the properties are optional
          and can be <a href="#rep.extension">extended over time</a>,
          as illustrated by the following Orderly schema [[Orderly]]:
        </p>
<pre class="orderly">

      <section id='rep.compliance'>
        <h4>Compliance Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>compliance</dfn></code> with an array value containing
          a list of URI references that identify specific regimes to which
          the origin server claims to comply for the designated resource.
          Communicating such a claim of compliance is presumed to improve
          transparency, which might influence a user's decisions or
          configurations regarding allowed tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an origin server sends a <a>TSV-extension</a> or an
          <a href="#rep.extension">extension property in the status object</a>
          that is not defined by successors of this specification, the
          origin server MUST send a <code>compliance</code> property that
          contains a reference to the definitive specification of that
          extension. If more than one reference in the <code>compliance</code>
          array defines the same extension value, the origin server SHOULD
          list the array of references in order by intended precedence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='rep.qualifiers'>
        <h4>Qualifiers Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>qualifiers</dfn></code> with a string value
          containing a sequence of case sensitive characters corresponding
          to explanations or limitations on the extent of tracking.
          Multiple qualifiers indicate that multiple explanations or forms
          of tracking might apply for the designated resource.
          The meaning of each qualifier is presumed to be defined by one
          or more of the regimes listed in <a>compliance</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='rep.controller'>
        <h4>Controller Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>controller</dfn></code> with an array value containing
          a list of URI references indirectly identifying the party or
          set of parties that claims to be the responsible data controller
          for personal data collected via the designated resource. An origin
          server MUST send a <code>controller</code> property if the
          responsible data controller does not own the designated resource's
          domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server that does not send <code>controller</code>
          is implying that its domain owner is the sole data controller;
          information about the data controller ought to be found on the
          designated resource's site root page, or by way of a clearly
          indicated link from that page (i.e., an absent controller property
          is equivalent to: <code>"controller":["/"]</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a>designated resource</a> has joint data controllers
          (i.e., multiple parties have independent control over the
          collected data), the origin server MUST send a
          <code>controller</code> property that contains a reference
          for each data controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each URI reference provided in <code>controller</code> ought to
          refer to a resource that, if a retrieval action is performed on
          that URI, would provide the user with information regarding (at a
          minimum) the identity of the corresponding party and its data
          collection practices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='rep.same-party'>
        <h4>Same-party Property</h4>
        <p>
          Since a user's experience on a given site might be composed of
          resources that are assembled from multiple domains, it might be
          useful for a site to distinguish those domains that are subject to
          their own control (i.e., share the same data controller as the
          referring site).
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>same-party</dfn></code> with an array value containing
          a list of domain names that the origin server claims are the same
          party, to the extent they are referenced by the designated
          resource, if all data collected via those references share the
          same data controller as the designated resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent might use the <code>same-party</code> array,
          when provided, to inform or enable different behavior for
          references that are claimed to be same-party versus those for
          which no claim is made. For example, a user agent might choose to
          exclude, or perform additional pre-flight verification of,
          requests to other domains that have not been claimed as same-party
          by the referring site.

        <h4>Audit Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>audit</dfn></code> with an array value containing a
          list of URI references to external audits of the designated
          resource's privacy policy and tracking behavior.
          Preferably, the audit references are to resources that describe
          the auditor and the results of that audit; however, if such a
          resource is not available, a reference to the auditor is
          sufficient.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='rep.policy'>
        <h4>Policy Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>policy</dfn></code> with a string value containing a
          URI reference to a human-readable document that describes the
          relevant privacy policy for the designated resource.
          This document can inform users about data that might be collected
          when the designated resource is accessed and how collection, use,
          or sharing of such data might differ based on receipt of an
          expressed tracking preference (<a>DNT:1</a> or <a>DNT:0</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MUST send a <code>policy</code> property if that
          server is the <a>effective script origin</a> of a script that calls
          the JavaScript API for storing a <a>user-granted exception</a>, as
          described in
          <a href="#exception-granting" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content of such a policy document is beyond the
          scope of this protocol and only supplemental to what is described
          in the machine-readable tracking status representation.
          If no <code>policy</code> property is provided, this
          information might be obtained via the links provided in
          <a>controller</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the policy associated with a designated resource happens to be
          defined as a common standard that is applicable to multiple sites,
          or includes such a standard by reference, that standard ought to be
          referenced by a URI within the machine-readable <a>compliance</a>
          property.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='rep.config'>
        <h4>Config Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>config</dfn></code> with a string value containing a
          URI reference to a resource for giving the user control over
          personal data collected via the designated resource (and possibly
          other resources).
          If the tracking status value indicates prior consent
          (<a>C</a>), the origin server MUST send a
          <code>config</code> property referencing a resource that
          describes how such consent is established and how to revoke that
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A config resource might include the ability to review
          past data collected, delete some or all of the data, provide
          additional data (if desired), or <q>opt-in</q>, <q>opt-out</q>,
          or otherwise modify an out-of-band consent status regarding
          data collection. The design of such a resource,
          the extent to which it can provide access to that data, and
          how one might implement an out-of-band consent mechanism are
          beyond the scope of this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          If no <code>config</code> property is provided, this

          accordingly.

      <p>
        If an origin server receives a request with <a>DNT:1</a>,
        does not have out-of-band consent for tracking this user, and
        wishes to deny access to the requested resource until the user
        provides some form of user-granted exception or consent for tracking,
        then the origin server SHOULD send a 409 (Conflict) response with a
        message payload that describes why the request has been refused and
        how one might supply the required consent or exception to avoid this
        conflict [[!RFC7231]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The 409 response ought to include a user authentication mechanism in

        <h4>Discovering Deployment</h4>
        <p>
          Deployment of this protocol for a given service can
          be discovered by making a retrieval request on the site-wide
          tracking resource <q><code>/.well-known/dnt/</code></q> relative
          to the service URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the response is an error, then the service does not implement
          this standard. If the response is a redirect, then follow the
          redirect to obtain the tracking status (up to some reasonable
          maximum of redirects to avoid misconfigured infinite request
          loops). If the response is successful, obtain the tracking status
          representation from the message payload, if possible, or consider
          it an error.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='using-preflight'>
        <h4>Preflight Checks</h4>
        <p>
          A key advantage of providing the tracking status at a resource
          separate from the site's normal services is that the status can
          be accessed and reviewed prior to making use of those services.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent can check the tracking status for a
          <a>designated resource</a> by first making a retrieval request for
          the site-wide tracking status representation, as described above,
          and then parsing the representation as JSON to extract the
          <a>status object</a>.
          If the retrieval is unsuccessful or parsing results in a syntax
          error, the user agent ought to consider the site to be
          non-conformant with this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>status object</a> is supposed to have a
          property named <code>tracking</code> containing the tracking
          status value. The meaning of each tracking status value is defined
          in <a href="#tracking-status-value" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status value is <a>N</a>, then the origin server
          claims that no tracking is performed for the designated resource
          for at least the next 24 hours or until the Cache-Control
          information indicates that this response expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status value is not <a>N</a>, then the origin
          server claims that it might track the user agent for requests on
          the URI being checked for at least the next 24 hours or until the
          Cache-Control information indicates that this response expires.

  <section id='security'>
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      Information communicated via the DNT header field is minimized to
      avoid abuse of the field for fingerprinting or as a side-channel.
      However, future DNT-extensions might allow for the sending of additional
      information when signaling consent for tracking via <a>DNT:0</a>,
      since this consent mechanism is intended to be more persistent than
      cookies and could be used to convey a pseudonymous identifier as a
      user-preferred alternative to allowing a cookie to be set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use of client-side storage is always a security concern. Although the
      information being stored for each <a>user-granted exception</a> is
      limited and cannot be directly accessed by scripts, storing too many
      exceptions might exceed available storage or indicate an attempt to
      exploit other vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also security concerns regarding the ability of scripts to
      store exceptions beyond the scope of their <a>effective script origin</a>.

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <section id='privacy.not-preconfigured'>
      <h3>Why DNT:1 is Not Preconfigured by Default</h3>

      <p>
        This specification defines a protocol for communicating the user's
        tracking preference, not a protocol that prevents tracking on its own.
        It might be tempting to assume that <q>design for privacy</q> would
        justify calling for <a>DNT:1</a> to be preconfigured as the default
        for all user agents. However, that would violate the field's semantics,
        make its presence in a request meaningless, and add eight extra bytes
        to every HTTP request (with no effect).
      </p>
      <p>
        The DNT signal alone does nothing to enhance a user's privacy.
        It is only when recipients believe that the signal has been
        deliberately and knowingly configured, and not defined as a default,
        that they will consider it to be the user's preference.
        Furthermore, when no signal is sent, recipients remain subject to
        whatever regulatory, legal, or other regional requirements regarding
        tracking exist in the absence of consent.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='privacy.fingerprinting'>
      <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>

          <p>
              User-granted exceptions introduce a privacy risk. By storing
              client-side configurable state and providing functionality to learn
              about it later, the user-granted exceptions API might facilitate user
              fingerprinting and tracking.
          </p>
          <p>
              For example an other-origin nested browsing context might create
              a set of <code>n</code> child browsing contexts then register
              exceptions for a random subset of them. The resulting <code>n</code>
              bit identifier could then be re-assembled in subsequent visits using
              standard cross-origin communication techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
              User agent developers ought to consider
              the possibility of fingerprinting during implementation and might
              consider rate-limiting requests, limiting the number of site-specific
              <a data-link-for="TrackingExData">targets</a> per
              <a>top-level browsing context</a>, or using other heuristics to
              mitigate the fingerprinting risk.
          </p>
    </section>

    <section id='privacy.history'>
      <h3>Stored Exceptions are Stored History</h3>

      <p>
        A database of stored exceptions is effectively storing a
        local history of the sites browsed by the user over time.
        Separate databases are needed per user profile (and per incognito
        session) and ought to be protected from observation. A user might
        wish to clear stored exceptions, or clear the database as a whole,
        but as a separate action from clearing the visible browser history.

      The DNT header field is based on the original <em>Do Not Track</em>
      submission by Jonathan&nbsp;Mayer (Stanford), Arvind&nbsp;Narayanan
      (Stanford), and Sid&nbsp;Stamm (Mozilla).
      The JavaScript DOM property for <code>doNotTrack</code> is based on the
      <em>Web Tracking Protection</em> submission by Andy&nbsp;Zeigler,
      Adrian&nbsp;Bateman, and Eliot&nbsp;Graff (Microsoft).
      Many thanks to Robin&nbsp;Berjon for ReSpec.js.
