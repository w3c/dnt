      This specification defines the <a>DNT</a> request header field as an
      HTTP mechanism for expressing a user's preference regarding tracking,
      an HTML DOM property to make that expression readable by scripts, and
      APIs that allow scripts to register exceptions granted by
      the user. It also defines mechanisms for sites to communicate whether
      and how they honor a received preference, including
      well-known resources for retrieving preflight tracking status,
      a media type for representing tracking status information, and the
      <q>Tk</q> response header field for confirming tracking status.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The World Wide Web consists of billions of resources interconnected
      through the use of hypertext. Hypertext provides a simple, page-oriented
      view of the information provided by those resources, which can be
      traversed by selecting links, manipulating controls, and supplying data
      via forms and search dialogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Web page is often composed of many information sources beyond the
      initial resource request, including embedded references to stylesheets,
      inline images, javascript, and other elements that might be
      automatically requested as part of the rendering or behavioral
      processing defined for that page. The user's experience is seamless,
      even if the page has been composed from the results of many network
      interactions with multiple servers. From the user's perspective, they
      are simply visiting and interacting with a single Web site: all of the
      technical details and protocol mechanisms used to compose a page to
      represent that site are hidden behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web site owners often collect data regarding usage of their sites, for a
      variety of purposes, including what led a user to visit the site
      (<dfn>referrals</dfn>), how effective the user experience is within the
      site (<dfn>web analytics</dfn>), and the nature of who is using the
      site (<dfn>audience segmentation</dfn>).
      In some cases, the data collected is used to dynamically adapt content
      (<dfn>personalization</dfn>) or advertising presented to the user
      (<dfn>targeted advertising</dfn>). Data collection often occurs through
      insertion of embedded elements on each page, resulting in a stream of
      data that connects a user's activity across multiple pages. A survey of
      these techniques and their privacy implications can be found in
      [[KnowPrivacy]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Users need a mechanism to express their own preferences regarding
      <a>tracking</a> that is both simple to configure and efficient when
      implemented. However, merely expressing a preference does not imply that
      all recipients will comply. In some cases, a server might be dependent
      on some forms of tracking and unwilling or unable to turn that off.
      In other cases, a server might perform only limited forms of tracking
      that would be acceptable to most users. Therefore, servers need
      mechanisms for communicating their own tracking behavior, requesting
      consent, and storing a <a>user-granted exception</a> once the user has
      made an informed choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification extends Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) semantics
      [[!RFC7231]] to communicate a user's tracking preference, if any, and an
      origin server's tracking behavior. The <a>DNT</a> request header field
      is defined for communicating the user's tracking preference for the
      <a>target resource</a>. A well-known URI for a
      <a href="#status-resource">tracking status resource</a> and the
      <a>Tk</a> response header field are defined for communicating the
      server's tracking behavior. In addition, JavaScript APIs are defined for
      enabling scripts to determine DNT status and register a user-granted
      exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification does not define requirements on what a recipient
      needs to do to comply with a user's expressed tracking preference,
      except for the means by which such compliance is communicated. Instead,
      the tracking status provides the ability to identify a set of compliance
      regimes to which the server claims to comply, with the assumption being
      that each regime defines its own requirements on compliant behavior.
      For example, [[TCS]] is a work-in-progress that intends to define such a
      compliance regime.

    <section id='terminology.activity'>
      <h3>Activity</h3>

      <p>
        <dfn>Tracking</dfn> is the collection of data regarding a particular
        user's activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention,
        use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the
        context in which it occurred.
        A <dfn>context</dfn> is a set of resources that are controlled by
        the same party or jointly controlled by a set of parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>network interaction</dfn> is a single HTTP request and its
        corresponding response(s): zero or more interim (1xx) responses and
        a single final (2xx-5xx) response.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>user action</dfn> is a deliberate action by the user, via
        configuration, invocation, or selection, to initiate a network
        interaction. Selection of a link, submission of a form, and
        reloading a page are examples of user actions.
        <dfn>User activity</dfn> is any set of such user actions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='terminology.participants'>
      <h3>Participants</h3>

      <p>
        A <dfn>user</dfn> is a natural person who is making, or has made,
        use of the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>party</dfn> is a natural person, a legal entity, or a set of
        legal entities that share common owner(s), common controller(s), and
        a group identity that is easily discoverable by a user. Common
        branding or providing a list of affiliates that is available via a
        link from a resource where a party describes DNT practices are
        examples of ways to provide this discoverability.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to a given user action, a <dfn>first party</dfn>
        is a party with which the user intends to interact, via one or more
        network interactions, as a result of making that action. Merely
        hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content
        does not constitute a user's intent to interact with another party.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a resource on the Web will be jointly controlled by
        two or more distinct parties. Each of those parties is considered a
        first party if a user would reasonably expect to communicate with
        all of them when accessing that resource. For example, prominent
        co-branding on the resource might lead a user to expect that
        multiple parties are responsible for the content or functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any data collected as a result of one or more network
        interactions resulting from a user's action,
        a <dfn>third party</dfn> is any party other than that user, a first
        party for that user action, or a service provider acting on behalf
        of either that user or that first party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to Web resources often involves multiple parties that might
        process the data received in a network interaction. For example,
        domain name services, network access points, content distribution
        networks, load balancing services, security filters, cloud
        platforms, and software-as-a-service providers might be a party to a
        given network interaction because they are contracted by either the
        user or the resource owner to provide the mechanisms for
        communication. Likewise, additional parties might be engaged after a
        network interaction, such as when services or contractors are used
        to perform specialized data analysis or records retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the data received in a given network interaction, a
        <dfn>service provider</dfn> is considered to be the same party as
        its <dfn>contractee</dfn> if the service provider:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>processes the data on behalf of the contractee;</li>
        <li>ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as
            directed by the contractee;</li>
        <li>has no independent right to use the data other than in a
            <a>permanently de-identified</a> form (e.g., for monitoring
            service integrity, load balancing, capacity planning, or
            billing); and,</li>
        <li>has a contract in place with the contractee which is consistent
            with the above limitations.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id='terminology.data'>
      <h3>Data</h3>

      <p>
        A party <dfn>collects</dfn> data received in a network interaction
        if that data remains within the party’s control after the network
        interaction is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        A party <dfn>uses</dfn> data if the party processes the data for any
        purpose other than storage or merely forwarding it to another party.
      </p>
      <p>
        A party <dfn>shares</dfn> data if it transfers or provides a copy of
        that data to any other party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is <dfn>permanently de-identified</dfn> when there exists a
        high level of confidence that no human subject of the data can be
        identified, directly or indirectly (e.g., via association with an
        identifier, user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
        combination with other retained or available information.

  <section id='determining'>
    <h2>Determining User Preference</h2>

    <p>
      The goal of this protocol is to allow a user to express their
      personal preference regarding tracking to each server and
      web application that they communicate with via HTTP, thereby allowing
      recipients of that preference to adjust tracking behavior accordingly
      or to reach a separate agreement with the user that satisfies all
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key to that notion of expression is that the signal sent MUST reflect
      the user's preference, not the choice of some vendor, institution,
      site, or network-imposed mechanism outside the user's control;
      this applies equally to both the general preference and exceptions.
      The basic principle is that a tracking preference expression is only
      transmitted when it reflects a deliberate choice by the user. In the
      absence of user choice, there is no tracking preference expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent MUST offer users a minimum of two alternative choices
      for a <q>Do Not Track</q> preference: <code><dfn>unset</dfn></code> or
      <code><dfn>DNT:1</dfn></code>.
      A user agent MAY offer a third alternative choice: <code><dfn>DNT:0</dfn></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user's choice is <a>DNT:1</a> or <a>DNT:0</a>, the
      tracking preference is <dfn>enabled</dfn>; otherwise, the
      tracking preference is <dfn>not enabled</dfn>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent MUST have a default tracking preference of
      <code>unset</code> (not enabled) unless a specific tracking preference
      is implied by the user's decision to use that agent. For example, use
      of a general-purpose browser would not imply a tracking preference
      when invoked normally as <q>SuperFred</q>, but might imply a
      preference if invoked as <q>SuperDoNotTrack</q> or
      <q>UltraPrivacyFred</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations of HTTP that are not under control of the user
      MUST NOT add, delete, or modify a tracking preference.
      Some controlled network environments, such as public access
      terminals or managed corporate intranets, might impose restrictions
      on the use or configuration of installed user agents, such that a
      user might only have access to user agents with a predetermined
      preference enabled.  However, if a user brings their
      own Web-enabled device to a library or cafe with wireless Internet
      access, the expectation will be that their chosen user agent and
      personal preferences regarding Web site behavior will not be
      altered by the network environment (aside from blanket limitations
      on what resources can or cannot be accessed through that network).
    </p>
    <p>
      An HTTP intermediary MUST NOT add, delete, or modify a tracking
      preference expression in a request forwarded through that intermediary
      unless the intermediary has been specifically installed or configured
      to do so by the user making the request. For example, an Internet
      Service Provider MUST NOT inject <a>DNT:1</a> on behalf
      of all users who have not expressed a preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      User agents often include user-installable <dfn>extensions</dfn>, also
      known as <dfn>add-ons</dfn> or <dfn>plug-ins</dfn>, that are
      capable of modifying configurations and making network requests. From
      the user's perspective, these extensions are considered part of the
      user agent and ought to respect the user's configuration of a tracking
      preference. The user agent as a whole is responsible for ensuring
      conformance with this protocol, to the extent possible, which means
      the user agent core and each extension are jointly responsible for
      conformance. However, there is no single standard for extension
      interfaces. A user agent that permits such extensions SHOULD provide
      an appropriate mechanism for extensions to determine the user's
      tracking preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      A user agent extension MUST NOT alter the tracking preference
      expression or its associated configuration unless the act of
      installing and enabling that extension is an explicit choice by the
      user for that tracking preference, or the extension itself complies
      with all of the requirements this protocol places on a user agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, software outside of the user agent might filter network
      traffic or cause a user agent's configuration to be changed.
      Software that alters a user agent configuration MUST adhere to the
      above requirements on a user agent extension. Software that filters
      network traffic MUST adhere to the above requirements on an HTTP
      intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the above requirements, we do not specify how the tracking
      preference choices are offered to the user or how the preference is
      enabled: each implementation is responsible for determining the user
      experience by which a tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a user might select a check-box in their user agent's
      configuration, install an extension that is specifically
      designed to add a tracking preference expression,
      or make a choice for privacy that then implicitly includes a
      tracking preference (e.g., <q>Privacy settings: high</q>).
      A user agent might ask the user for their preference during startup,
      perhaps on first use or after an update adds the tracking protection
      feature. Likewise, a user might install or configure a proxy to add
      the expression to their own outgoing requests.

    <h2>Expressing a Tracking Preference</h2>

    <section id='expression-format'>
      <h3>Expression Format</h3>
      <p>
        When a user has <a>enabled</a> a tracking preference, that
        preference needs to be expressed to all mechanisms that might
        perform or initiate <a>tracking</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a>enabled</a>, a tracking preference is expressed as either:
      </p>
      <table class="simple">
        <tr><th>DNT</th>
            <th>meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>1</td>
            <td>This user prefers not to be tracked on this request.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>0</td>
            <td>This user prefers to allow tracking on this request.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST NOT send a tracking preference expression if
        a tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>.  This means that no
        expression is sent for each of the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the user agent does not implement this protocol;</li>
        <li>the user has not yet made a choice for a specific preference;
            or,</li>
        <li>the user has chosen not to transmit a preference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, servers
        MAY interpret the lack of an expressed tracking preference as they
        find most appropriate for the given user, particularly when
        considered in light of the user's privacy expectations and cultural
        circumstances. Likewise, servers might make use of other preference
        information outside the scope of this protocol, such as
        site-specific user preferences or third-party registration services,
        to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit preference is
        expressed via this protocol.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This specification defines a protocol for communicating the user's
        tracking preference, not a protocol that prevents tracking on its own.
        It might be tempting to assume that <q>design for privacy</q> would
        justify calling for <a>DNT:1</a> to be preconfigured as the default
        for all user agents. However, that would violate the field's semantics,
        make its presence in a request meaningless, and add eight extra bytes
        to every HTTP request (with no effect).<br />
        <br />
        The DNT signal alone does nothing to enhance a user's privacy.
        It is only when recipients believe that the signal has been
        deliberately and knowingly configured, and not defined as a default,
        that they will consider it to be the user's preference.
        Furthermore, when no signal is sent, recipients remain subject to
        whatever regulatory, legal, or other regional requirements regarding
        tracking exist in the absence of consent.

      <h3>DNT Header Field for HTTP Requests</h3>

      <p>
        The <code><dfn>DNT</dfn></code> header field is a mechanism for expressing the
        user's tracking preference in an HTTP request ([[!RFC7230]]).
        At most one <code>DNT</code> header field can be present in a valid request.
      </p>
<pre class="abnf">
DNT-field-name  = "DNT"
DNT-field-value = ( "0" / "1" ) *DNT-extension
</pre>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field if the
        user's tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST generate a <code>DNT</code> header field with a
        field-value that begins with the numeric character "1" if the user's
        tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>, their preference is for
        <a>DNT:1</a>, and no exception has been granted for the
        target resource (see <a href="#exceptions" class="sectionRef"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MUST generate a <code>DNT</code> header field with a
        field-value that begins with the numeric character "0" if the user's
        tracking preference is <a>enabled</a> and their preference is for
        <a>DNT:0</a>, or if an exception has been granted for
        the target resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proxy MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field unless it has
        been specifically installed or configured to do so by the user
        making the request and adheres to the above requirements as if it
        were a user agent.

        <h4>Extensions to the DNT Field Value</h4>

        <p>
          The remainder of the <a>DNT</a> field-value, after the initial character,
          is reserved for future extensions. DNT extensions can only be
          transmitted when a tracking preference is <a>enabled</a>.
          The extension syntax is restricted to visible ASCII characters that
          can be parsed as a single word in HTTP and safely embedded in a
          JSON string without further encoding
          (<a href="#status-representation" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">

                ; excludes CTL, SP, DQUOTE, comma, backslash
</pre>
        <p>
          For example, additional characters might indicate modifiers to the
          main preference expressed by the first digit, such that the main
          preference will be understood if the recipient does not understand
          the extension. Hence, a field-value of "1xyz" can be thought of
          as <q>do not track, but if you understand the refinements defined
          by x, y, or z, then adjust my preferences according to those
          refinements.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents that do not implement DNT extensions MUST NOT send
          DNT-extension characters in the <a>DNT</a> field-value.
          Servers that do not implement DNT extensions SHOULD ignore
          anything beyond the first character.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This DNT-extension feature is at-risk because no known
          extensions have been defined; implementors that do not read this
          specification are likely to assume that DNT only has the
          fixed values of "0" or "1". Furthermore, the potential benefits
          of this mechanism are unclear given that extension information
          could be supplied using separate request header fields and
          inappropriate extensions to the "1" value might cause the user's

        A user's tracking preference is intended to apply in general,

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        In addition to expressing the user's preference regarding tracking,
        this protocol enables servers to communicate machine-readable claims
        regarding their own tracking behavior. Since a personalized tracking
        status on every response would disable caching, a combination of
        response mechanisms are defined to allow the tracking status to be
        communicated prior to making a trackable request and without making
        every response dynamic.

      <h3>Tracking Status Value</h3>

      <section id='TSV-defn'>
        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>
          A <dfn>tracking status value</dfn> (<dfn>TSV</dfn>) is a single
          character response to the user's tracking preference with regard to
          data collected via the <dfn>designated resource</dfn>.
          For a site-wide tracking status resource, the designated resource
          is any resource on the same origin server.
          For a <a>Tk</a> response header field, the <a>target resource</a> of the
          corresponding request is the designated resource, and remains so
          for any subsequent request-specific tracking status resource
          referred to by the Tk field value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tracking status value is case sensitive, as defined formally
          by the following ABNF.
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">

        <h4>Under Construction (!)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>!</dfn></code> means that the origin
          server is currently testing its communication of tracking status.
          The <code>!</code> value has been provided to ease testing and
          deployment on production systems during the initial periods of
          testing compliance and during adjustment periods due to future
          protocol changes or shifting regulatory constraints. Note that
          this value does not indicate that the user's preference will be
          ignored, nor that tracking will occur as a result of accessing
          the designated resource.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='TSV-?'>
        <h4>Dynamic (?)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>?</dfn></code> means the origin server
          needs more information to determine tracking status, usually
          because the <a>designated resource</a> dynamically adjusts
          behavior based on information in a request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <code>?</code> is present in the site-wide tracking status,
          the origin server MUST send a <a>Tk</a> header field in all
          responses to requests on the designated resource.
          If <code>?</code> is present in the <a>Tk</a> header field,
          more information will be provided in a request-specific
          tracking status resource referred to by the <a>status-id</a>.
          An origin server MUST NOT send <code>?</code> as the
          tracking status value in the representation of a
          request-specific tracking status resource.

      <section id='TSV-G'>
        <h4>Gateway (G)</h4>
        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>G</dfn></code> means the server
          is acting as a gateway to an exchange involving multiple parties.
          This might occur if a response to the <a>designated resource</a>
          involves an automated selection process, such as dynamic bidding,
          where the party that is selected determines how the request data
          will be treated with respect to an expressed tracking preference.
          Similar to the <a>?</a> value, the <code>G</code> TSV
          indicates that the actual tracking status is dynamic and will be
          provided in the response message's <a>Tk</a> header field,
          presumably using information forwarded from the selected party.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tracking status value is only valid as a site-wide status.
          A server MUST NOT send <code>G</code> as the
          tracking status value in a <a>Tk</a> header field or within the
          representation of a request-specific tracking status resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <code>G</code> is present in the site-wide tracking status:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the gateway MUST send a link within its site-wide
            tracking status representation to a privacy policy that
            explains what limitations are placed on parties that
            might receive data via that gateway;</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST forward any expressed tracking
            preference in the request to each party that receives data
            from that request;</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST have a contract in place with each of the
            parties to whom it provides request data such that only the
            selected party is allowed to retain tracking data from a
            request with an expressed tracking preference of
            <a>DNT:1</a>; and,</li>
          <li>the gateway MUST send a <a>Tk</a> header field in
            responses to requests on the designated resource and include
            within that field's value a <a>status-id</a>
            specific to the selected party, such that information about
            the selected party can be obtained via the request-specific
            tracking status resource (see
            <a href="#request-specific-status-resource" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With respect to tracking performed by the gateway itself, the
          <code>G</code> response can be considered equivalent
          to the <a>T</a> (tracking) response defined below.
          The other information within the site-wide tracking status
          representation indicates how the gateway intends to comply
          with an expressed tracking preference, aside from the potential
          sharing of data implied by the gateway process.

          user, user agent, or device, perhaps via some mechanism not
          defined by this specification, and that prior consent overrides
          the tracking preference expressed by this protocol.
          An origin server that sends the <code>C</code> tracking status
          value for a <a>designated resource</a> MUST provide a reference
          for controlling consent within the <a>config</a>
          property of its corresponding tracking status representation

          server does not know, in real-time, whether it has received prior
          consent for tracking this user, user agent, or device, but
          promises not to use or share any <a>DNT:1</a> data

          received for which such consent has not been received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this status value does not itself indicate whether a
          specific request is tracked, an origin server that sends a
          <code>P</code> tracking status value MUST provide a
          <a>config</a> property in the corresponding tracking
          status representation that links to a resource for obtaining
          consent status.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>P</code> tracking status value is specifically meant to
          address audience survey systems for which determining consent at
          the time of a request is either impractical, due to legacy systems
          not being able to keep up with Web traffic, or potentially "gamed"
          by first party sites if they can determine which of their users
          have consented. The data cannot be used for the sake of
          personalization. If consent can be determined at the time of a
          request, the <a>C</a> tracking status is preferred.

          received from the requesting user agent.  An origin server that
          sends the <code>D</code> tracking status value MUST detail within
          the server's corresponding privacy policy the conditions under
          which a tracking preference might be disregarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an origin server might disregard the DNT field
          received from specific user agents (or via specific network
          intermediaries) that are deemed to be non-conforming, might be
          collecting additional data from specific source network
          locations due to prior security incidents, or might be
          compelled to disregard certain DNT requests to comply with a
          local law, regulation, or order.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This specification is written with an assumption that the
          <code>D</code> tracking status value would only be used in
          situations that can be adequately described to users as an
          exception to normal behavior. If this turns out not to be the
          case, either the server's decision to send the <code>D</code>
          signal needs re-examination, or this specification, or both.

        <p>
          A tracking status value of <code><dfn>U</dfn></code> means that the request
          resulted in a potential change to the tracking status applicable
          to this user, user agent, or device. A user agent that relies on a
          cached tracking status SHOULD update the cache entry with the
          current status by making a new request on the applicable tracking
          status resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MUST NOT send <code>U</code> as a tracking status

      <h3>Tk Header Field for HTTP Responses</h3>

      <section id='Tk-header-defn'>
        <h4>Definition</h4>

        <p>
          The <code><dfn>Tk</dfn></code> response header field is a means for indicating
          the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request.
          An origin server is REQUIRED to send a <code>Tk</code> header
          field if its site-wide tracking status value is <a>?</a>
          (dynamic) or <a>G</a> (gateway), or when an interactive change is
          made to the tracking status and indicated by <a>U</a> (updated).
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
Tk-field-name   =  "Tk"
Tk-field-value  =  TSV [ ";" status-id ]
</pre>
        <p>
          The Tk field-value begins with a tracking status value
          (<a href="#tracking-status-value" class="sectionRef"></a>),
          optionally followed by a semicolon and a <code>status-id</code>
          that refers to a request-specific tracking status resource
          (<a href="#referring-status-id" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a Tk header field for a resource that claims not to
          be tracking would look like:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">Tk: N</pre>
      </section>

      <section id='referring-status-id'>
        <h4>Referring to a Request-specific Tracking Status Resource</h4>
        <p>
          If an origin server has multiple, request-specific tracking
          policies, such that the tracking status might differ depending on
          some aspect of the request (e.g., method, <a>target resource</a>, header
          fields, data, etc.), the origin server can provide an additional
          subtree of well-known resources corresponding to each of those
          distinct tracking statuses. The <code><dfn>status-id</dfn></code>
          portion of the <code>Tk</code> field-value indicates which specific
          tracking status resource applies to the current request.
          The <code>status-id</code> is case-sensitive.
        </p>
<pre class="abnf">
status-id       =  1*id-char
id-char         =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / "+" / "=" / "/"
</pre>
        <p>
          For example, a response containing
        </p>
        <pre class="example">Tk: T;fRx42</pre>
        <p>
          indicates that data collected via the target resource might be
          used for tracking and that an applicable tracking status
          representation can be obtained by performing a retrieval request
          on
        </p>
        <pre>/.well-known/dnt/fRx42</pre>
        <p>
          Note that the <code>status-id</code> is resolved relative
          to the origin server of the current request.  A retrieval request
          targeting that URI can be redirected, if desired, to some other
          server.  The <code>status-id</code> has been intentionally limited
          to a small set of characters to encourage use of short tokens
          instead of potentially long, human-readable strings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a Tk field-value has a tracking status value of
          <a>?</a> (dynamic), the origin server MUST
          send a <code>status-id</code> in the field-value.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='interactive-status-change'>
        <h4>Indicating an Interactive Status Change</h4>
        <p>
          Interactive mechanisms might be used, beyond
          the scope of this specification, that have the effect of asking
          for and obtaining prior consent for tracking, or for modifying
          prior indications of consent.  For example, the tracking status
          resource's status object defines a <a>config</a>
          property that can refer to such a mechanism. Although such
          out-of-band mechanisms are not defined by this specification,
          their presence might influence the tracking status object's
          response value.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an origin server provides a mechanism via HTTP for
          establishing or modifying out-of-band tracking preferences,
          the origin server MUST indicate within the mechanism's response
          when a state-changing request has resulted in a change to the
          tracking status for that server.  This indication of an
          interactive status change is accomplished by sending a
          <a>Tk</a> header field in the response with a tracking status
          value of <a>U</a> (updated).

      <section id='site-wide-status-resource'>
        <h4>Site-wide Tracking Status</h4>
        <p>
          A <dfn>site-wide tracking status resource</dfn> provides
          information about the potential tracking behavior of resources
          located at that origin server. A site-wide tracking status
          resource has the well-known identifier
        </p>
        <pre>/.well-known/dnt/</pre>
        <p>
          relative to the origin server's URI [[RFC5785]].
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server that receives a valid <code>GET</code> request
          targeting its site-wide tracking status resource MUST send either
          a successful response containing a machine-readable representation
          of the site-wide tracking status, as defined below, or a sequence
          of redirects that leads to such a representation. Failure to
          provide access to such a representation implies that the
          origin server does not implement this protocol.
          The representation can be cached, as described
          in <a href="#status-caching" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="#using-tracking-status" class="sectionRef"></a> for

        <h4>Request-specific Tracking Status</h4>
        <p>
          If an origin server has multiple, request-specific tracking
          policies, such that the tracking status might differ depending on
          some aspect of the request (e.g., method, target resource, header
          fields, data, etc.), the origin server can provide an additional
          subtree of well-known resources corresponding to each of those
          distinct tracking statuses.  The <a>Tk</a> response header field
          (<a href="#response-header-field" class="sectionRef"></a>) can
          include a <a>status-id</a> to indicate which specific
          tracking status resource applies to the current request.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>tracking status resource space</dfn> is defined by the

        </p>
        <pre class="example">Tk: ?;ahoy</pre>
        <p>
          refers to the specific tracking status resource
        </p>
        <pre>/.well-known/dnt/ahoy</pre>
        <p>
          Resources within the request-specific tracking status resource
          space are represented using the same format as a site-wide
          tracking status resource.

      </section>

      <section id='status-checks-not-tracked'>
        <h4>Status Checks are Not Tracked</h4>
        <p>
          When sending a request for the tracking status, a user agent
          SHOULD include any cookie data [[RFC6265]] (set prior to the
          request) that would be sent in a normal request to that origin
          server, since that data might be needed by the server to determine
          the current tracking status. For example, the cookie data might
          indicate a prior out-of-band decision by the user to opt-out or
          consent to tracking by that origin server.
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MUST NOT retain tracking data regarding requests
          on the site-wide tracking status resource or within the tracking
          status resource space, regardless of the presence, absence, or
          value of a DNT header field, cookies, or any other information in
          the request.
          In addition, an origin server MUST NOT send Set-Cookie or
          Set-Cookie2 header fields in responses to those requests,
          including the responses to redirected tracking status requests,
          and MUST NOT send a response having content that initiates
          tracking beyond what was already present in the request.
          A user agent SHOULD ignore, or treat as an error, any Set-Cookie
          or Set-Cookie2 header field received in such a response.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='status-caching'>
        <h4>Caching</h4>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is applicable to all users, regardless of
          the received <a>DNT</a> field-value and other data received via the
          request, then the origin server SHOULD mark the response as
          cacheable [[!RFC7234]] and assign a time-to-live (expiration or
          max-use) that is sufficient to enable shared caching but not
          greater than the earliest point at which the service's tracking
          behavior might increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if the tracking status response is set to expire in
          seven days, then the earliest point in time that the service's
          tracking behavior can be increased is seven days after the
          tracking status representation has been
          updated to reflect the new behavior, since old copies might
          persist in caches until the expiration is triggered. A service's
          tracking behavior can be reduced at any time, with or without a
          corresponding change to the tracking status resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is only applicable to users that have
          the same <a>DNT</a> field-value, the origin server MUST send a
          Vary header field that includes "DNT" in its field-value or a
          Cache-Control header field containing one of the following
          directives: "private", "no-cache", "no-store", or "max-age=0".
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status is only applicable to the specific user
          that requested it, then the origin server MUST send a
          Cache-Control header field containing one of the following
          directives: "private", "no-cache", or "no-store".
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of the cache-control settings, it is expected that
          user agents will check the tracking status of a service only once
          per session (at most).  A public Internet site that intends to
          change its tracking status to increase tracking behavior MUST
          update the tracking status resource in accordance with that
          planned behavior at least twenty-four hours prior to activating
          that new behavior on the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent that adjusts behavior based on active verification
          of tracking status, relying on cached tracking status responses
          to do so, SHOULD check responses to its state-changing requests
          (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for a <a>Tk</a> header field
          with the <a>U</a> tracking status value, as described in

        This media type consists of a <a>status object</a>

          designated resource's site root page, or by way of a clearly
          indicated link from that page (i.e., an absent controller property
          is equivalent to: <code>"controller":["/"]</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a>designated resource</a> has joint data controllers
          (i.e., multiple parties have independent control over the
          collected data), the origin server MUST send a
          <code>controller</code> property that contains a reference
          for each data controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each URI reference provided in <code>controller</code> ought to
          refer to a resource that, if a retrieval action is performed on
          that URI, would provide the user with information regarding (at a
          minimum) the identity of the corresponding party and its data
          collection practices.

      <section id='rep.same-party'>
        <h4>Same-party Property</h4>
        <p>
          Since a user's experience on a given site might be composed of
          resources that are assembled from multiple domains, it might be
          useful for a site to distinguish those domains that are subject to
          their own control (i.e., share the same data controller as the
          referring site).
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>same-party</dfn></code> with an array value containing
          a list of domain names that the origin server claims are the same
          party, to the extent they are referenced by the designated
          resource, if all data collected via those references share the
          same data controller as the designated resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent might use the <code>same-party</code> array,
          when provided, to inform or enable different behavior for
          references that are claimed to be same-party versus those for
          which no claim is made. For example, a user agent might choose to
          exclude, or perform additional pre-flight verification of,
          requests to other domains that have not been claimed as same-party
          by the referring site.

          list of URI references to external audits of the designated
          resource's privacy policy and tracking behavior.
          Preferably, the audit references are to resources that describe
          the auditor and the results of that audit; however, if such a
          resource is not available, a reference to the auditor is
          sufficient.

        <h4>Policy Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>policy</dfn></code> with a string value containing a
          URI reference to a human-readable document that describes the
          relevant privacy policy for the designated resource.
          This document can inform users about data that might be collected
          when the designated resource is accessed and how collection, use,
          or sharing of such data might differ based on receipt of an
          expressed tracking preference (<a>DNT:1</a> or <a>DNT:0</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MUST send a <code>policy</code> property if that
          server is the <a>effective script origin</a> of a script that calls
          the JavaScript API for storing a <a>user-granted exception</a>, as
          described in

        </p>
        <p>
          The content of such a policy document is beyond the
          scope of this protocol and only supplemental to what is described
          in the machine-readable tracking status representation.
          If no <code>policy</code> property is provided, this
          information might be obtained via the links provided in
          <a>controller</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the policy associated with a designated resource happens to be
          defined as a common standard that is applicable to multiple sites,
          or includes such a standard by reference, that standard ought to be
          referenced by a URI within the machine-readable <a>compliance</a>

        <h4>Config Property</h4>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send a property named
          <code><dfn>config</dfn></code> with a string value containing a
          URI reference to a resource for giving the user control over
          personal data collected via the designated resource (and possibly
          other resources).
          If the tracking status value indicates prior consent
          (<a>C</a>), the origin server MUST send a
          <code>config</code> property referencing a resource that
          describes how such consent is established and how to revoke that
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A config resource might include the ability to review
          past data collected, delete some or all of the data, provide
          additional data (if desired), or <q>opt-in</q>, <q>opt-out</q>,
          or otherwise modify an out-of-band consent status regarding
          data collection. The design of such a resource,
          the extent to which it can provide access to that data, and
          how one might implement an out-of-band consent mechanism are
          beyond the scope of this protocol.

        <h4>Extensions to the Status Object</h4>

          Extensibility of the status object ensures that this protocol will

          evolve over time and compliance specifications are developed
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          An origin server MAY send additional properties in the <a>status

          version of this specification or a compliance regime
          identified within the <a>compliance</a> property.
          Aside from storage or presentation of a server's response,

      <p>
        If an origin server receives a request with <a>DNT:1</a>,
        does not have out-of-band consent for tracking this user, and
        wishes to deny access to the requested resource until the user
        provides some form of user-granted exception or consent for tracking,
        then the origin server SHOULD send a 409 (Conflict) response with a

        how one might supply the required consent or exception to avoid this
        conflict [[!RFC7231]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The 409 response ought to include a user authentication mechanism in

        This section is for collecting use cases that describe questions a
        user agent might have about tracking status and how the protocol

      <section id='using-deployment'>
        <h4>Discovering Deployment</h4>
        <p>
          Deployment of this protocol for a given service can
          be discovered by making a retrieval request on the site-wide
          tracking resource <q><code>/.well-known/dnt/</code></q> relative
          to the service URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the response is an error, then the service does not implement
          this standard. If the response is a redirect, then follow the
          redirect to obtain the tracking status (up to some reasonable
          maximum of redirects to avoid misconfigured infinite request
          loops). If the response is successful, obtain the tracking status
          representation from the message payload, if possible, or consider
          it an error.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id='using-preflight'>
        <h4>Preflight Checks</h4>
        <p>
          A key advantage of providing the tracking status at a resource
          separate from the site's normal services is that the status can
          be accessed and reviewed prior to making use of those services.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent can check the tracking status for a
          <a>designated resource</a> by first making a retrieval request for
          the site-wide tracking status representation, as described above,
          and then parsing the representation as JSON to extract the
          <a>status object</a>.
          If the retrieval is unsuccessful or parsing results in a syntax
          error, the user agent ought to consider the site to be
          non-conformant with this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>status object</a> is supposed to have a
          property named <code>tracking</code> containing the tracking
          status value. The meaning of each tracking status value is defined
          in <a href="#tracking-status-value" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status value is <a>N</a>, then the origin server
          claims that no tracking is performed for the designated resource
          for at least the next 24 hours or until the Cache-Control
          information indicates that this response expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tracking status value is not <a>N</a>, then the origin
          server claims that it might track the user agent for requests on
          the URI being checked for at least the next 24 hours or until the
          Cache-Control information indicates that this response expires.

    <h2>User-Granted Exceptions</h2>

    <section id="exception-principles">
      <h3>Motivating Principles</h3>

      <p>
        The following principles guide the design of user-granted exceptions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content providers might wish to prompt visitors to their
          properties to <q>opt back in</q> to tracking for behavioral
          advertising or similar purposes when they arrive with the Do Not
          Track setting enabled.</li>
        <li>Privacy-conscious users might wish to view or edit all the
          exceptions they've granted in a single, consistent user interface,
          rather than managing preferences in a different way on every
          content provider or tracker's privacy page.</li>
        <li>Granting an exception in one context (e.g., while browsing a news
          site) does not imply that exception is applicable to other contexts
          (e.g., browsing an unrelated medical site).</li>
        <li>Tracking providers ought to be able to avoid second-guessing a
          user's expressed tracking preference.</li>
        <li>The solution need not require cross-domain communication
          between a first-party publisher and its third parties.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="exception-model">
      <h3>Exception Model</h3>

      <p>
        A <dfn>user-granted exception</dfn> is the record of a decision by
        the user to grant consent for tracking (<a>DNT:0</a>) on future
        requests from a given context to a set of target domains.
        Both context and target are scoped by domain, similar to the existing
        domain scope of cookies
        (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#relaxing-the-same-origin-restriction">Section 5.3.1</a>
        of [[!HTML5]]), in order to avoid asking the user's exception for
        every subdomain context of a site and every target resource that
        might be referenced.
      </p>
      <p>
        A client-side database can be used for persistent storage of
        user-granted exceptions, such that permission to send <a>DNT:0</a>
        is obtained by a site and stored via a JavaScript API. However, we
        only define the API (below); the choice of storage mechanism is left
        to each implementation. In comparison to the use of cookies to manage
        consent, an exception database and APIs provide more transparency and
        better user control over their own consent decisions, while also
        providing better persistence of those exceptions for sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are potentially three different domain concepts involved
        in the processing of user-granted exceptions:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>script domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>the default context of a script when it accesses the exception
          database: specifically, the current <a>document.domain</a> of the
          script's <a>responsible document</a>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn>site domain</dfn></dd>
        <dd>the context of a given reference for which the user-granted exceptions API
          might be queried: specifically, the current <a>document.domain</a>
          of the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn>target domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>the <a>uri-host</a> subcomponent of the <a>authority</a> component
          of a referenced "http" or "https" URI</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A user-granted exception is <dfn>site-specific</dfn> if the context
        is limited to requests embedded in, or referred by, a given
        <a>site domain</a>; otherwise, the exception is <dfn>web-wide</dfn>
        and applies to all contexts. For example, a user might wish to grant
        a target domain a web-wide exception for the purpose of audience
        surveys, perhaps in exchange for some incentive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asking for a <a>site-specific</a> exception, the site
        making the request might make some implicit or explicit claims as
        to the actions and behavior of its third parties; for this reason,
        a site might want to establish exceptions for only those target
        domains for which it can be sure that those claims are true.
        (Consider a site that has some trusted advertisers and analytics
        providers, along with some mashed-up content from less-trusted
        sites). For this reason, site-specific exceptions can either be
        limited to a named set of target domains or applicable to any target
        domain ("*").
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='exception-granting'>
      <h3>Granting an Exception</h3>

      <p class="ednote">
        This section is supposed to describe how a site would go about asking
        the user for the various types of exception. The existing text is
        lacking that necessary information.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is expected that a site will explain to the user, in its online
        content, the need for an exception and the consequences of granting or
        denying that exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent adds to its local database one or more site-pair
        duplets [document-origin, target]; one or the other of these MAY be a
        wild-card ("*").
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MAY ask for an exception, and have it stored, even when the
        user's general preference is <a>not enabled</a>. This permits the
        sending of <a>DNT</a> only for target resources for which an
        expressed preference is desired (see
        <a href="#exception-when-not-enabled" class="sectionRef"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MUST ensure that a call to store an exception reflects the
        user's intention to grant an exception at the time of that call. It
        is the sole responsibility of the site to determine that a call to
        record an exception reflects the user's informed consent at the
        time of that call.
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MAY monitor for changes to its user-granted exceptions.
        If a user revokes consent by deleting an exception, the site MUST
        respect that revocation, though it MAY ask again for a new
        exception. In other words, a site MUST NOT resurrect a deleted
        exception without first interacting with and receiving new 
        consent from the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        A site MUST have a <a>site-wide tracking status resource</a>
        with a valid
        <a href="#status-representation">tracking status representation</a>
        that includes a <a>policy</a> property when making an API call to
        store a user-granted exception.
        This allows a user agent to obtain and possibly store additional
        information about the calling site’s controller and tracking
        policies at the time an exception is granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MAY choose to reject an API call if it cannot determine
        the script origin or if the script origin does not have a
        <a>site-wide tracking status resource</a> with a valid
        <a href="#status-representation">tracking status representation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent MAY choose to disregard a user-granted exception when
        the <a>target resource</a> does not have a corresponding tracking
        status resource with a valid tracking status representation, since
        that would imply the <a>target resource</a> does not conform to this
        specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user-agent MUST handle each API request as a 'unit', granting and
        maintaining it in its entirety, or not at all. That means that a
        user agent MUST NOT indicate to a site that a request for targets
        {a, b, c} exists in the database, and later remove only one or two
        of {a, b, c} from its logical database of remembered grants. This
        assures sites that the set of sites they need for operational
        integrity is treated as a unit. Each separate call to an API is a
        separate unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no required user interface for a user agent regarding the
        granting of exceptions; a user agent MAY choose to provide none.
        Alternatively, a user agent MAY:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>indicate that a call to store an exception has just been
          made;</li>
        <li>allow the user to confirm a user-granted exception prior
          to storage;</li>
        <li>indicate that one or more exceptions exist for the
          current top-level origin;</li>
        <li>indicate that one or more exceptions exist for sites
          incorporated into the current page; or,</li>
        <li>indicate how to <a href="#exception-management">manage the
          exceptions granted</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>
        When an explicit list of domains is provided through the API,
        their names might mean little to the user. The user might, for
        example, be told that there is a stored exception for a specific
        set of sites on such-and-such top-level origin, rather than
        listing them by name; or the user agent might decide to store a
        site-wide exception, effectively ignoring any list of domain names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if a wild-card is used, the user might be told that
        there is a stored exception for all third-parties that are embedded
        by the indicated top-level origin.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='exception-management'>
      <h3>Exception Management</h3>

      <p>
        User agents are free to implement exception management user
        interfaces as they see fit. Some agents might provide a notification
        to the user at the time of the request, or even not complete the
        storing of the exception until the user approves. Some agents might
        provide a user-interface to see and edit the database of recorded
        exception grants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API parameters siteName, explanationString,
        and detailURI are provided so that the user agent can use them in
        their user interface. If a user agent presents these parameters to the
        user, it ought to be clear that they are provided for informational
        value and are less important than the exception's technical effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent that chooses to highlight when tracking exceptions have
        been stored might provide an interface like the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>an icon in the status bar indicating that an exception has been
          stored, which, when clicked on, gives the user more information
          about the exception and an option to revoke it.</li>
        <li>an infobar stating "Example News (news.example.com) has

        In some user agent implementations, decisions to grant exceptions
        might have been made in the past (and since forgotten) or might have
        been made by other users of the device. Thus, exceptions might not
        always represent the current preferences of the user. Some user
        agents might choose to provide ambient notice that user-opted
        tracking is ongoing, or easy access to view and control these
        preferences. Users might also desire to edit exceptions within a
        separate user interface, which would allow a user to modify their
        stored exceptions without visiting the target sites.

      <h3>Checking an Exception</h3>

      <p>
        A user agent is expected to query the exceptions database at the
        time of a request in order to determine what value (if any) to send
        as the user's tracking preference.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>While the user is browsing a given site (top-level origin),
          and a DNT header field is to be sent to a target domain, if the
          duplet [top-level origin, target domain] matches any duplet in the
          database, then a <a>DNT:0</a> preference is sent,
          otherwise the user’s general preference is sent (if any).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A pair of duplets [A,B] and [X,Y] match if A matches X and B matches Y.
        A pair of values A and X match if and only if one of the following
        is true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>either A or X is "*";</li>
        <li>A and X are the same string;</li>
        <li>A has the form '*.domain' and X is 'domain' or is of the form
          'string.domain', where 'string' is any sequence of characters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, responses to the JavaScript API indicated should be
        consistent with this user preference (see below).

      <h3>Exception API</h3>

      <p class="ednote">
        We currently specify six different APIs (plus the doNotTrack property
        which now appears to be useless) with three distinct definitions of
        an exception record and three distinct return types. Also, we use a
        single (inappropriate) exception to signal all errors.<br />
        <br />
        What we should have is one exception record and three APIs for
        store/confirm/delete with a single Promise&lt;T&gt; return type and
        a distinct exception name for each error. The interfaces should be
        defined using an algorithm similar to other specifications of
        promise-based interfaces. We should also remove the expires field
        since it was intended to be replaced (everywhere) by maxAge and
        is only kept in HTTP for legacy reasons.

                Calling <code>storeTrackingException</code> returns a
                <code>Promise</code> which either resolves to an
                <code><a>ExceptionResult</a></code> object, or is rejected with a
                <code>DOMException</code> result. The
                <code>Promise</code> resolves immediately the Tracking Exception
                request has been processed, with the property
                <code>isSiteWide</code> set to <code>true</code> if the
                request was for a site-specific exception and the resulting operation is site-wide.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the request is for a site-specific exception and it does not include the
                <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code>, then this request is for a
                site-wide, site-specific  exception. Otherwise each string in

            <p>
                If the list <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code> is supplied and the request is for a site-specific exception, the
                user agent MAY choose to store a site-wide, site-specific exception. If it does

                can be set to a fully-qualified right-hand segment of the document
                host name, up to one level below TLD.

                <code>"example.com"</code>, but not to
                <code>"something.else.example.com"</code> or <code>"com"</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If <code>domain</code> is not specified or is null or empty then the request would be processed as if it had been set to
                the <a>script domain</a>.
                In the description below the variable <em>Domain</em> would have the value <a>script domain</a>

                remembered grant will be cancelled (i.e. processed as if the

                If both <code>maxAge</code> and <code>expires</code> are supplied,
                <code>maxAge</code> has precedence. If neither <code>maxAge</code>

              <dt><code><dfn>domain</dfn></code></dt>
              <dd>
                  a cookie-domain as defined in [[!RFC6265]],
                  to which the exception applies.

              <dt><code><dfn>arrayOfDomainStrings</dfn></code></dt>
              <dd>A JavaScript array of strings.</dd>
          </dl>
        <p>
          If <code>isWebWide</code> is not <code>true</code> and the call does not include the
          <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code>, then this call is to confirm a
          site-wide exception. Otherwise each string in
          <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code> specifies a
          <a>target domain</a>.
        </p>
          <p>
              If <code>isWebWide</code> is not <code>true</code>, the list <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code> is supplied, and the
              user agent stores only site-wide exceptions, then the user agent
              MUST match by confirming a site-wide exception.
          </p>
          <p>
              If <code>domain</code> is supplied and not empty then it is
              treated in the same way as the domain parameter to cookies and
              allows setting for subdomains. The <code>domain</code> argument
              can be set to a fully-qualified right-hand segment of the document
              host name, up to one level below TLD.
              In the description below the variable <em>Domain</em> would have the value <code>*.domain</code>
          </p>
          <p>
              If <code>domain</code> is not specified or is null or empty then the request would be processed as if it had been set to
              the <a>script domain</a>.
              In the description below the variable <em>Domain</em> would have the value <a>script domain</a>
          </p>
          <p>
              If <code>isWebWide</code> is <code>true</code> then any <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code> is ignored, and
              the user agent MUST match by confirming a web-wide exception, i.e. the database is checked for the duplet:

          </p>
          <pre>[*,Domain]</pre>
        <p>
          If the user agent stores explicit lists, <code>isWebWide</code> is not <code>true</code> and the call includes
          an  <code>arrayOfDomainStrings</code>, the database is checked for the existence of all the duplets
          (one per target):
        </p>
        <pre>[Domain, target domain]</pre>
        <p>
          If <code>isWebWide</code> is not <code>true</code>, the user agent stores only site-wide exceptions or the call did
          not include an explicit list, the database is checked for the
          single duplet:
        </p>
        <pre>[Domain, * ]</pre>
        <p>
          If <code>isWebWide</code> is not <code>true</code>, the user agent stores explicit lists and the call includes
          one, then the database is checked for the existence of all the
          duplets (one per target):
        </p>
          <pre>[Domain, target domain]</pre>
          <p>
              Any processing failure, such as an incorrectly formatted parameter in the <a>ConfirmExceptionPropertyBag</a>,
              will result in no duplet being removed from the data base of remebered grants, and
              the returned <code>Promise</code> being
              rejected with a <code>DOMException.SYNTAX_ERR</code>.
          </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise the returned <code>Promise</code> resolves to a
          <code>ExceptionResult</code> object which MUST contain a
          <code>boolean</code> property <code><dfn>exists</dfn></code> with
          the following possible values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>true</code> all the duplets exist in the database;</li>
          <li><code>false</code> one or more of the duplets does not exist
              in the database.</li>

      <h3>Exceptions without Interactive JavaScript</h3>

      <p>
        Some third party servers that might wish to receive a user-granted
        exception do not have the ability to invoke an interactive JavaScript
        presence on a page (for example, those that provide only images or
        "tracking pixels"). They cannot request an exception under these
        circumstances because a script is needed to make the API call and
        it requires interaction to ensure the user is informed and to receive
        an indication of their consent. In general, this process of informing,
        getting consent, and calling the API is not expected within page
        elements where such trackers are invoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        To obtain an exception, a document (page, frame, etc.) that loads the
        JavaScript is needed. The user might visit the site that desires an
        exception directly, or the first party might provide a separate page
        that could load script-enabled frames in which each third party
        could ask for an exception (allowing for aggregation of requests).
      </p>
      <p>
        In all these ways, the site is contributing to informing the user and
        obtaining their consent, while enabling a call to the Javascript API
        when such consent is granted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="exception-when-not-enabled">
      <h3>Exceptions without an Expressed Preference</h3>

      <p>
        Sites might wish to request exceptions even when a user arrives
        without a DNT header field. Users might wish to grant permission
        for tracking on or by certain sites even without
        expressing a general tracking preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        User agents MAY instantiate
        <code>Navigator.storeSiteSpecificTrackingException</code> even when
        <code>Navigator.doNotTrack</code> is null. Scripts SHOULD test for the
        existence of <code>storeSiteSpecificTrackingException</code> before
        calling the method. If an exception is granted and the user agent
        stores that preference, a user agent might send the
        <a>DNT:0</a> tracking preference even if it has not
        enabled preferences to be sent for other requests. Persisted
        exceptions MAY affect which preference is transmitted if a user
        later chooses to configure a general tracking preference.

    <section id="exception-by-sites" class="informative">
      <h3>Exception Use by Sites</h3>

      <p>
        This section is to inform the authors of sites on some considerations
        in using the user-granted exceptions APIs to best effect; sites of
        particular interest here are those that need an exception in order to
        allow the user to perform some operation or to have some access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Store' calls return immediately, without a return value.
        If there is a problem with the calling parameters, then
        a Javascript exception will be thrown.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent might not store the exception immediately, possibly
        because it is allowing the user to confirm. Even though the site has
        acquired the user's informed consent before calling the 'Store' API,
        it is possible that the user will change their mind, allow the
        storing of an exception to proceed but later remove it, or perhaps
        deny the storage by prior configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, at the time of the call, the site has acquired the
        user's consent and can proceed on that basis, whether or not the
        user-agent has stored the exception immediately. It is not necessary
        to call the confirm API at the time of consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        On other visits, a site can call the 'Confirm' APIs to enquire
        whether a specific exception has been granted and stands in the user
        agent. This is the call to make to determine whether the exception
        exists, and hence to control access to the function or operation; if
        it fails (the exception has been deleted or not yet granted), then
        the user is ideally again offered the information needed to give
        their informed consent, and again offered the opportunity to
        indicate that they grant it. As stated in the normative text, the
        site needs to explain and acquire consent immediately prior to
        calling the Store API, and not remember some past consent; this
        allows a user to change their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they do grant it (using some positive interaction such as a
        button), the site can return to checking the 'Confirm' API.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way the site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>does not assume that the storage is instantaneous and
          mistakenly grant access when the exception does not (yet) stand;</li>
        <li>does not call the Confirm API repeatedly, in a loop, without a
          user-interaction between each call; and,</li>
        <li>permits the user the opportunity to delete a previously
        granted exception.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>

      <p>
        User-granted exceptions introduce a privacy risk. By storing
        client-side configurable state and providing functionality to learn
        about it later, the user-granted exceptions API might facilitate user
        fingerprinting and tracking. User agent developers ought to consider
        the possibility of fingerprinting during implementation and might
        consider rate-limiting requests or using other heuristics to mitigate
        fingerprinting risk.
